  title: March
  itemtype: Book
  author: Geraldine Brooks
  description: "  From Louisa May Alcott\xE2\x80\x99s beloved classic <I>Little Women</I>, Geraldine Brooks has animated the   character of the absent father, March, and crafted a story \"filled with the ache of love and marriage and   with the power of war upon the mind and heart of one unforgettable man\" (Sue Monk Kidd). With  \"pitch-perfect writing\" (<I>USA Today</I>), Brooks follows March as he leaves behind his family to aid   the Union cause in the Civil War. His experiences will utterly change his marriage and challenge his most   ardently held beliefs. A lushly written, wholly original tale steeped in the details of another time,   <I>March</I> secures Geraldine Brooks\xE2\x80\x99s place as a renowned author of historical fiction."
