    - Geraldine Brooks
    - "  From Louisa May Alcott\xE2\x80\x99s beloved classic <I>Little Women</I>, Geraldine Brooks has animated the   character of the absent father, March, and crafted a story \"filled with the ache of love and marriage and   with the power of war upon the mind and heart of one unforgettable man\" (Sue Monk Kidd). With  \"pitch-perfect writing\" (<I>USA Today</I>), Brooks follows March as he leaves behind his family to aid   the Union cause in the Civil War. His experiences will utterly change his marriage and challenge his most   ardently held beliefs. A lushly written, wholly original tale steeped in the details of another time,   <I>March</I> secures Geraldine Brooks\xE2\x80\x99s place as a renowned author of historical fiction."

    - Jeffrey Eugenides
    - "<b>A dazzling triumph from the bestselling author of <i>The Virgin Suicides</i>--the astonishing tale of a gene that passes down through three generations of a Greek-American family and flowers in the body of a teenage girl.</b><br><br>In the spring of 1974, Calliope Stephanides, a student at a girls' school in Grosse Pointe, finds herself drawn to a chain-smoking, strawberry blond clasmate with a gift for acting. The passion that furtively develops between them--along with Callie's failure to develop--leads Callie to suspect that she is not like other girls. In fact, she is not really a girl at all.<br><br>The explanation for this shocking state of affairs takes us out of suburbia- back before the Detroit race riots of 1967, before the rise of the Motor City and Prohibition, to 1922, when the Turks sacked Smyrna and Callie's grandparents fled for their lives. Back to a tiny village in Asia Minor where two lovers, and one rare genetic mutation, set in motion the metamorphosis that will turn Callie into a being both mythical and perfectly real: a hermaphrodite.<br><br>Spanning eight decades--and one unusually awkward adolescence- Jeffrey Eugenides's long-awaited second novel is a grand, utterly original fable of crossed bloodlines, the intricacies of gender, and the deep, untidy promptings of desire. It marks the fulfillment of a huge talent, named one of America's best young novelists by both <i>Granta </i>and <i>The New Yorker</i>.<br>"

    - "As the American century draws to an uneasy close, Philip Roth gives us a novel of unqualified greatness that is an elegy for all our century's promises of prosperity, civic order,  and domestic bliss. Roth's protagonist is Swede Levov, a legendary athlete at his Newark high school, who grows up in the booming postwar years to marry a former Miss New Jersey, inherit his father's glove factory, and move into a stone house in the idyllic hamlet of Old Rimrock. And then one day in 1968, Swede's beautiful American luck deserts him.<br><br>For Swede's adored daughter, Merry, has grown from a loving, quick-witted girl into a sullen, fanatical teenager\xE2\x80\x94a teenager capable of an outlandishly savage act of political terrorism. And overnight Swede is wrenched out of the longer-for American pastoral and into the indigenous American berserk. Compulsively readable, propelled by sorrow, rage, and a deep compassion for its characters, this is Roth's masterpiece."

    - Sidney Poitier
    - "\"I have no wish to play the pontificating fool, pretending that I\xE2\x80\x99ve suddenly come up with the answers to all life\xE2\x80\x99s questions. Quite that contrary, I began this book as an exploration, an exercise in self-questing. In other words, I wanted to find out, as I looked back at a long and complicated life, with many twists and turns, how well I\xE2\x80\x99ve done at measuring up to the values I myself have set.\"  <BR>--Sidney Poitier    <P>In this luminous memoir, a true American icon looks back on his celebrated life and career. His body of work is arguably the most morally significant in cinematic history, and the power and influence of that work are indicative of the character of the man behind the many storied roles. Sidney Poitier here explores these elements of character and personal values to take his own measure -- as a man, as a husband and a father, and as an actor.    <P>Poitier credits his parents and his childhood on tiny Cat Island in the Bahamas for equipping him with the unflinching sense of right and wrong and of self-worth that he has never surrendered and that have dramatically shaped his world. \"In the kind of place where I grew up,\" recalls Poitier, \"what\xE2\x80\x99s coming at you is the sound of the sea and the smell of the wind and momma\xE2\x80\x99s voice and the voice of your dad and the craziness of your brothers and sisters \xE2\x80\xA6 and that\xE2\x80\x99s it.\" Without television, radio, and material distractions to obscure what matters most, he could enjoy the simple things, endure the long commitments, and find true meaning in his life.    <P>Poitier was uncompromising as he pursued a personal and public life that would honor his upbringing and the invaluable legacy of his parents. Just a few years after his introduction to indoor plumbing and the automobile, Poitier broke racial barrier after racial barrier to launch a pioneering acting career. Committed to the notion that what one does for a living articulates to who one is, Poitier played only forceful and affecting characters who said something positive, useful, and lasting about the human condition.    <P>Here is Poitier\xE2\x80\x99s own introspective look at what has informed his performances and his life. Poitier explores the nature of sacrifice and commitment, price and humility, rage and forgiveness, and paying the price for artistic integrity. What emerges is a picture of a man in the face of limits \xE2\x80\x93 his own and the world\xE2\x80\x99s. A triumph of the spirit, <I>The Measure of a Man</i> captures the essential Poitier."

    - Leo Tolstoy
    - <I>Anna Karenina</I> tells of the doomed love affair between the  sensuous and rebellious Anna and the dashing officer, Count  Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and  must endure the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and richly  textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major  characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of  city and country life and all the variations on love and family  happiness.  While previous versions have softened the robust, and  sometimes shocking, quality of Tolstoy's writing, Pevear and  Volokhonsky have produced a translation true to his powerful  voice. This award-winning team's authoritative edition also includes  an illuminating introduction and explanatory notes. Beautiful,  vigorous, and eminently readable, this <I>Anna Karenina</I> will be  the definitive text for generations to come.

    - The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (Oprah's Book Club)
    - Book
    - Carson McCullers
    - With the publication of her first novel, THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER,  Carson McCullers, all of twenty-three, became a literary  sensation. With its profound sense of moral isolation and its  compassionate glimpses into its characters' inner lives, the novel is  considered McCullers' finest work, an enduring masterpiece first  published by Houghton Mifflin in 1940. At its center is the deaf-mute  John Singer, who becomes the confidant for all various types of  misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for  escape from small town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane,  Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's  heroine (and loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her  music. Wonderfully attune to the spiritual isolation that underlies  the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the  South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives  voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated -- and,  through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal  search for beauty.<BR> Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her  ability "to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace  white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness."  She writes "with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming," said  the NEW YORK TIMES. McCullers became an overnight literary sensation,  but her novel has endured, just as timely and powerful today as when  it was first published. THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER is Carson  McCullers at her most compassionate, endearing best.

    - "<p>One of the 20th century's enduring works, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize\xE2\x80\x93winning career.</p> <p>The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buend\xC3\xADa family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buend\xC3\xADa family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America.</p> <p>Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel Garc\xC3\xADa M\xC3\xA1rquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.</p> <p>Alternately reverential and comical, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.</p>"

    - <i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i> is a beautifully told and profoundly  compassionate story of the Zulu pastor Stephen Kumalo and his son  Absalom, set in the troubled and changing South Africa of the 1940s.

    - Elie Wiesel
    - <I>Night</I> is Elie Wiesel's masterpiece, a candid, horrific, and deeply  poignant autobiographical account of his survival as a teenager in the  Nazi death camps. This new translation by Marion Weisel, Elie's wife  and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language  and spirit truest to the author's original intent.  And in the  substantive new preface, Elie Wiesel reflects on the enduring  importance of <I>Night</I> and his lifelong, passionate dedication to  ensuring that the world never forgets man capacity for inhumanity to  man.    <P><I>Night</I> offers much more than a litany of the daily terrors, everyday  perversions, and rampant sadism at Auschwitz and Buchenwald; it also  eloquently addresses many of the philosophical as well as personal  questions implicit in any serious consideration of what the Holocaust  was, what it meant, and what its legacy is and will be.

The drive is a risk, sure, but it's a part of the American Dream, a chance to carve a new life out of the last remaining wilderness.    <P>"Once again, McMurtry spins a yarn about the West -- and also about the nature of friendship, of folly, of responsibility, of moral codes and men and their destinies."

Roth's protagonist is Swede Levov, a legendary athlete at his Newark high school, who grows up in the booming postwar years to marry a former Miss New Jersey, inherit his father's glove factory, and move into a stone house in the idyllic hamlet of Old Rimrock. And then one day in 1968, Swede's beautiful American luck deserts him.<br><br>For Swede's adored daughter, Merry, has grown from a loving, quick-witted girl into a sullen, fanatical teenager\xE2\x80\x94a teenager capable of an outlandishly savage act of political terrorism. And overnight Swede is wrenched out of the longer-for American pastoral and into the indigenous American berserk. Compulsively readable, propelled by sorrow, rage, and a deep compassion for its characters, this is Roth's masterpiece."

    - "<P> <B>Pearl S. Buck's epic Pulitzer Prize-winning novel of a China that was -- now in a Contemporary Classics edition.</B> <P> Though more than sixty years have passed since this remarkable novel won the Pulitzer Prize, it has retained its popularity and become one of the great modern classics. \"I can only write what I know, and I know nothing but China, having always lived there,\" wrote Pearl Buck. In <I>The Good Earth</I> she presents a graphic view of a China when the last emperor reigned and the vast political and social upheavals of the twentieth century were but distant rumblings for the ordinary people. This moving, classic story of the honest farmer Wang Lung and his selfless wife O-lan is must reading for those who would fully appreciate the sweeping changes that have occurred in the lives of the Chinese people during this century. <P> Nobel Prize winner Pearl S. Buck traces the whole cycle of life: its terrors, its passions, its ambitions and rewards. Her brilliant novel -- beloved by millions of readers -- is a universal tale of the destiny of man."

    - Book
    - Annie Proulx
    - <P> Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, <I>The Shipping News</I> is a celebration of Annie Proulx's genius for storytelling and her vigorous contribution to the art of the novel. <P> Quoyle, a third-rate newspaper hack, with a "head shaped like a crenshaw, no neck, reddish hair...features as bunched as kissed fingertips," is wrenched violently out of his workaday life when his two-timing wife meets her just deserts. An aunt convinces Quoyle and his two emotionally disturbed daughters to return with her to the starkly beautiful coastal landscape of their ancestral home in Newfoundland. Here, on desolate Quoyle's Point, in a house empty except for a few mementos of the family's unsavory past, the battered members of three generations try to cobble up new lives. <P> Newfoundland is a country of coast and cove where the mercury rarely rises above 70 degrees, the local culinary delicacy is cod cheeks, and it's easier to travel by boat and snowmobile than on anything with wheels. In this harsh place of cruel storms, a collapsing fishery, and chronic unemployment, the aunt sets up as a yacht upholsterer in nearby Killick-Claw, and Quoyle finds a job reporting the shipping news for the local weekly, the <I>Gammy Bird</I> (a paper that specializes in sexual-abuse stories and grisly photos of car accidents). <P> As the long winter closes its jaws of ice, each of the Quoyles confronts private demons, reels from catastrophe to minor triumph -- in the company of the obsequious Mavis Bangs; Diddy Shovel the strongman; drowned Herald Prowse; cane-twirling Beety; Nutbeem, who steals foreign news from the radio; a demented cousin the aunt refuses to recognize; the much-zippered Alvin Yark; silent Wavey; and old Billy Pretty, with his bag of secrets. By the time of the spring storms Quoyle has learned how to gut cod, to escape from a pickle jar, and to tie a true lover's knot.

    - Anna Karenina (Oprah's Book Club)
    - Book
    - Leo Tolstoy
    - <I>Anna Karenina</I> tells of the doomed love affair between the  sensuous and rebellious Anna and the dashing officer, Count  Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and  must endure the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and richly  textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major  characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of  city and country life and all the variations on love and family  happiness.  While previous versions have softened the robust, and  sometimes shocking, quality of Tolstoy's writing, Pevear and  Volokhonsky have produced a translation true to his powerful  voice. This award-winning team's authoritative edition also includes  an illuminating introduction and explanatory notes. Beautiful,  vigorous, and eminently readable, this <I>Anna Karenina</I> will be  the definitive text for generations to come.

    - The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter
    - Book
    - Carson McCullers
    - With the publication of her first novel, THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER,  Carson McCullers, all of twenty-three, became a literary  sensation. With its profound sense of moral isolation and its  compassionate glimpses into its characters' inner lives, the novel is  considered McCullers' finest work, an enduring masterpiece first  published by Houghton Mifflin in 1940. At its center is the deaf-mute  John Singer, who becomes the confidant for all various types of  misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for  escape from small town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane,  Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's  heroine (and loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her  music. Wonderfully attune to the spiritual isolation that underlies  the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the  South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives  voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated -- and,  through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal  search for beauty.<BR> Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her  ability "to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace  white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness."  She writes "with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming," said  the NEW YORK TIMES. McCullers became an overnight literary sensation,  but her novel has endured, just as timely and powerful today as when  it was first published. THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER is Carson  McCullers at her most compassionate, endearing best.

    - Gabriel Garcia Marquez
    - "<p>One of the 20th century's enduring works, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize\xE2\x80\x93winning career.</p> <p>The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buend\xC3\xADa family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buend\xC3\xADa family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America.</p> <p>Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel Garc\xC3\xADa M\xC3\xA1rquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.</p> <p>Alternately reverential and comical, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.</p>"

    - <i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i> is a beautifully told and profoundly  compassionate story of the Zulu pastor Stephen Kumalo and his son  Absalom, set in the troubled and changing South Africa of the 1940s.    The book is written with such keen empathy and understanding that to  read it is to share fully in the gravity of the characters'  situations. It both touches your heart deeply and inspires a renewed  faith in the dignity of mankind.

    - Book
    - Toni Morrison
    - Toni Morrison's first novel, <b>The Bluest Eye</b> (1970), was acclaimed as the work of an important talent, written--as John Leonard said in <i>The New York Times</i>--in a prose "so precise, so faithful to speech and so charged with pain and wonder that the novel becomes poetry."<br><br><b>Sula</b> has the same power, the same beauty.<br><br>At its center--a friendship between two women, a friendship whose intensity first sustains, then injures. Sula and Nel--both black, both smart, both poor, raised in a small Ohio town--meet when they are twelve, wishbone thin and dreaming of princes.<br><br>Through their girlhood years they share everything--perceptions, judgments, yearnings, secrets, even crime--until Sula gets out, out of the Bottom, the hilltop neighborhood where beneath the sporting life of the men hanging around the place in headrags and soft felt hats there hides a fierce resentment at failed crops, lost jobs, thieving insurance men, bug-ridden flour...at the invisible line that cannot be overstepped.  <br><br>Sula leaps it and roams the cities of America for ten years. Then she returns to the town, to her friend. But Nel is a wife now, settled with her man and her three children. She belongs. She accommodates to the Bottom, where you avoid the hand of God by getting in it, by staying <i>upright,</i> helping out at church suppers, asking after folks--where you deal with evil by surviving it.  <br><br>Not Sula. As willing to feel pain as to give pain, she can never accommodate. Nel can't understand her any more, and the others never did. Sula scares them. Mention her now, and they recall that she put her grandma in an old folks' home (the old lady who let a train take her leg for the insurance)...that a child drowned in the river years ago...that there was a plague of robins when she first returned...<br><br>In clear, dark, resonant language, Toni Morrison brilliantly evokes not only a bond between two lives, but the harsh, loveless, ultimately mad world in which that bond is destroyed, the world of the Bottom and its people, through forty years, up to the time of their bewildered realization that even more than they feared Sula, their pariah, they needed her.

    - With a compassionate realism and narrative sweep that recall the work of Charles Dickens, this magnificent novel captures all the cruelty and corruption, dignity and heroism, of India. The time is 1975. The place is an unnamed city by the sea. The government has just declared a State of Emergency, in whose upheavals four strangers--a spirited widow, a young student uprooted from his idyllic hill station, and two tailors who have fled the caste violence of their native village--will be thrust together, forced to share one cramped apartment and an uncertain future. <br><br>As the characters move from distrust to friendship and from friendship to love, <b>A Fine Balance</b> creates an enduring panorama of the human spirit in an inhuman state.

The oldest, Gary, a once-stable portfolio manager and family man, is trying to convince his wife and himself, despite clear signs to the contrary, that he is not clinically depressed. The middle child, Chip, has lost his seemingly secure academic job and is failing spectacularly at his new line of work.

    - Lalita Tademy
    - "Lalita Tademy was a successful vice president at Sun Microsystems when she began what became an obsessive two-year search to uncover the story of her family's roots. It was a personal odyssey that took her back to the early l800s and a small rural community on Louisiana's Cane River. There, digging through official records, conducting interviews, and relying on the expertise of professional genealogists, Tademy was able to bring to vivid life four remarkable women--her great, great, great, great grandmother Elisabeth; her great, great, great grandmother Suzette; her great, great grandmother Philomene; and her great-grandmother Emily.  Beginning in slavery, sweeping through the Civil War, and bringing us into the pre-Civil Rights South, we follow the struggles of these four women through extraordinary hardships as they learn to empower themselves and, despite overwhelming pressures, get their due and preserve their heritage. Meticulously researched and beautifully written, this woman's Roots presents a slice of American history never before seen in such piercing and personal detail.  "

    - Gwyn Hyman Rubio
    - In the tradition of <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> and <i>The Cape Ann</i>, a funny, sad, wise, and redeeming first novel about a young girl's battle with a troubling affliction.  Rural Kentucky in the 1950s is not an easy place to grow up in, and it's especially hard for 10-year-old Icy Sparks, an orphan who lives with her grandparents. Life becomes even more difficult for Icy when the violent tics and uncontrollable cursing begin. Icy's adolescence is marred by the humiliation brought on by her mysterious condition, and its all-too-visible symptoms are the source of endless hilarity as everyone around her offers an opinion about what's troubling the girl. Eventually, Icy finds solace in the company of an obese woman who knows what it's like to be an outcast in this tightly knit Appalachian community. Narrated by a now-grown Icy, this first novel shimmers with warmth and humor as it recounts a young girl's painful and poignant journey to womanhood--and the many lives she touches and enriches along the way.<br> <br>--<i>Icy Sparks</i> was a <i>New York Times</i> Editor's Choice <br> <br>"Awesomely intelligent . . . Robinson's accurate but unstuffy writing has done much to popularize wine and make it accessible to new drinkers." --<i>The Guardian</i> (London)

Her eccentric mother tries to help by fixing her up with dates, but a more pressing problem is money. To meet her mortgage payments, Sam decides to take in boarders. The first is an older woman who offers sage advice and sorely needed comfort; the second, a maladjusted student, is not quite so helpful. A new friend, King, an untraditional man, suggests that Samantha get out, get going, get work. But her real work is this: In order to emerge from grief and the past, she has to learn how to make her own happiness. In order to really see people, she has to look within her heart. And in order to know who she is, she has to remember--and reclaim--the person she used to be, long before she became someone else in an effort to save her marriage. Open House is a love story about what can blossom between a man and a woman, and within a woman herself.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

Instead, he's constantly reminded of just how messed up his life is.<BR>     With his mother in jail for killing his abusive father, Harley is an orphan with the responsibilities of an adult and the fiery, aggressive libido of a teenager. Just nineteen years old, he's marooned in the Pennsylvania backwoods caring for his three younger sisters, whose feelings about him range from stifling dependence to loathing. And once he develops an obsession with the sexy, melancholic mother of two living down the road, those Victoria's Secret catalogs just won't do the trick anymore. He wants Callie Mercer so badly he fears he will explode. But it's the family secrets, the lies, and the unspoken truths that light the fuse and erupt into a series of staggering surprises, leaving what's left of his family in tatters. Through every ordeal, the unforgettable Harley could never know that his endearing humor, his love for his sisters, and his bumbling heroics would redeem them all.<BR>     Funny and heartbreaking, Tawni O'Dell's pitch-perfect characters capture the maddening confusion of adolescence and the prickly nature of family with irony and unerring honesty. <I>Back Roads</I> is a riveting novel by a formidable new talent."

    - A. Manette Ansay
    - <p> In a stark, troubling, yet ultimately triumphant celebration of self-determination, award-winning author A. Manette Ansay re-creates a stifling world of guilty and pain, and the tormented souls who inhabit it. It is 1972 when circumstance carries Ellen Grier and her family back to Holly's Field, Wisconsin. Dutifully accompanying her newly unemployed husband, Ellen has brought her two children into the home of her in-laws on Vinegar Hill -- a loveless house suffused with the settling dust of bitterness and routine -- where calculated cruelty is a way of life preserved and perpetuated in the service of a rigid, exacting and angry God. Behind a facade of false piety, there are sins and secrets in this place that could crush a vibrant young woman's passionate spirit. And here Ellen must find the straight to endure, change, and grow in the all-pervading darkness that threatens to destroy everything she is and everyone she loves. </p>

    - Billie Letts
    - "Oprah Book Club-\xC2\xAB Selection, December 1998: A funny thing happens to Novalee Nation on her way to Bakersfield, California. Her ne'er-do-well boyfriend, Willie Jack Pickens, abandons her in an Oklahoma Wal-Mart and takes off on his own, leaving her with just 10 dollars and the clothes on her back. Not that hard luck is anything new to Novalee, who is \"seventeen, seven months pregnant, thirty-seven pounds overweight--and superstitious about sevens.... For most people, sevens were lucky. But not for her,\" Billie Letts writes. \"She'd had a bad history with them, starting with her seventh birthday, the day Momma Nell ran away with a baseball umpire named Fred...\"Still, finding herself alone and penniless in Sequoyah, Oklahoma is enough to make even someone as inured to ill fortune as Novalee want to give up and die. Fortunately, the Wal-Mart parking lot is the Sequoyah equivalent of a town square, and within hours Novalee has met three people who will change her life: Sister Thelma Husband, a kindly eccentric; Benny Goodluck, a young Native American boy; and Moses Whitecotton, an elderly African American photographer. For the next two months, Novalee surreptitiously makes her home in the Wal-Mart, sleeping there at night, exploring the town by day. When she goes into labor and delivers her baby there, however, Novalee learns that sometimes it's not so bad to depend on the kindness of strangers--especially if one of them happens to be Sam Walton, the superchain's founder.Where the Heart Is oddly mixes heart-warming vignettes and surprising, brutal violence. Novalee's story is juxtaposed with occasional chapters chronicling Willy Jack's downward spiral into prison, disappointment, and degradation. And even in Sequoyah, sudden storms, domestic violence, kidnapping, and deadly fires punctuate Novalee's progress from homeless, unwed teen mom to successful, happy member of the community. This is not a subtle book; there's never any doubt that our heroine will make a home for herself and her baby or that Willy Jack will get what he deserves for abandoning them. Still, Billie Letts has created several memorable characters, and there's always room for another novel that celebrates the life-affirming qualities of reading, the importance of education, and the power of love to change lives. --Alix Wilber"

    - Toni Morrison
    - "\"They shoot the white girl first. With the others they can take their time.\" Toni Morrison's first novel since she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature opens with a horrifying scene of mob violence then chronicles its genesis in a small all-black town in rural Oklahoma. Founded by descendants of free slaves as intent on isolating themselves from the outside world as it once was on rejecting them, the patriarchal community of Ruby is built on righteousness, rigidly enforced moral law, and fear. But seventeen miles away, another group of exiles has gathered in a promised land of their own. And it is upon these women in flight from death and despair that nine male citizens of Ruby will lay their pain, their terror, and their murderous rage... <P> Paradise is a tour de force of storytelling power, richly imagined and elegantly composed. Morrison challenges our most fiercely held beliefs as she weaves folklore and history, memory and myth, into an unforgettable meditation on race, religion, gender, and the way a society can turn on itself until it is forced to explode."

    - Stones from the River
    - Book
    - Ursula Hegi
    - <I>Stones from the River</I> is a daring, dramatic and complex novel of life in Germany. It is set in Burgdorf, a small fictional German town, between 1915 and 1951. The protagonist is Trudi Montag, a Zwerg -- the German word for dwarf woman. As a dwarf she is set apart, the outsider whose physical "otherness" has a corollary in her refusal to be a part of Burgdorf's silent complicity during and after World War II. Trudi establishes her status and power, not through beauty, marriage, or motherhood, but rather as the town's librarian and relentless collector of stories.  <P>Through Trudi's unblinking eyes, we witness the growing impact of Nazism on the ordinary townsfolk of Burgdorf as they are thrust on to a larger moral stage and forced to make choices that will forever mark their lives. <I>Stones from the River</I> is a story of secrets, parceled out masterfully by Trudi -- and by Ursula Hegi -- as they reveal the truth about living through unspeakable times.

    - Norman Mailer
    - "Winner of the 1980 Pulitzer Prize<br><br>In what is arguably his greatest book, America's most heroically ambitious writer follows<br>the short, blighted career of Gary Gilmore, an intractably violent product of America's<br>prisons who became notorious for two reasons: first, for robbing two men in 1976, then<br>killing them in cold blood; and, second, after being tried and convicted, for insisting on<br>dying for his crime. To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on<br>keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death.<br><br>Norman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his<br>procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a<br>restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. The<br>Executioner's Song is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of<br>American loneliness and violence. It is a towering achievement--impossible to put down, impossible to forget."

    - Ernest Hemingway
    - <P> <I>The Old Man and the Sea</I> is one of Hemingway's most enduring works. Told in language of great simplicity and power, it is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, down on his luck, and his supreme ordeal -- a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Here Hemingway recasts, in strikingly contemporary style, the classic theme of courage in the face of defeat, of personal triumph won from loss. Written in 1952, this hugely successful novella confirmed his power and presence in the literary world and played a large part in his winning the 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature.

    - Book
    - James Gould Cozzens
    - "<i>Guard of Honor</i> is a neglected masterpiece that stands comparison with the greatest novels of the Second World War--essayist Noel Perrin deemed it \"probably the best war novel of the twentieth century.\"<br>\t<br>James Gould Cozzens's <i>Guard of Honor</i> won the Pulitzer Prize in 1949. The novel balances a vast cast of intricately enmeshed characters as they react over the course of three tense days in September 1943 to a racial incident on a U.S. Army airbase in Florida. The reader is acutely aware of the war raging abroad and the effect it has had, or will have, on the multitude of servicemen who populate Cozzens's immense canvas. As Noel Perrin commented in <i>The Washington Post Book World:</i> \"There is material for two or three hundred movies in <i>Guard of Honor</i>.\"<br>\t<br>\"No other American novelist of our time writes with such profound understanding of the wellsprings of human character and of the social pressures that help to form it,\" said Orville Prescott in <i>The New York Times</i>. As Brendan Gill observed in <i>The New Yorker</i>: \"Every page of <i>Guard of Honor</i> gives the impression of a writer at the very top of his powers setting out to accomplish nothing less than his masterwork.\"<br>"

But just a few years after the defeat of Hitler, the British colonial government detained nearly the entire population of Kenya's largest ethnic minority, the Kikuyu-some one and a half million people.<br><br>The compelling story of the system of prisons and work camps where thousands met their deaths has remained largely untold-the victim of a determined effort by the British to destroy all official records of their attempts to stop the Mau Mau uprising, the Kikuyu people's ultimately successful bid for Kenyan independence. <br><br>Caroline Elkins, an assistant professor of history at Harvard University, spent a decade in London, Nairobi, and the Kenyan countryside interviewing hundreds of Kikuyu men and women who survived the British camps, as well as the British and African loyalists who detained them. <br><br>The result is an unforgettable account of the unraveling of the British colonial empire in Kenya-a pivotal moment in twentieth- century history with chilling parallels to America's own imperial project.<br>

    - Book
    - Steve Coll
    - "From the managing editor of the <i>Washington Post</i>, a news-breaking account of the CIA's involvement in the covert wars in Afghanistan that fueled Islamic militancy and gave rise to bin Laden's al Qaeda.  <br><br>  For nearly the past quarter century, while most Americans were unaware, Afghanistan has been the playing field for intense covert operations by U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies-invisible wars which sowed the seeds of the September 11 attacks and which provide its context. From the Soviet invasion in 1979 through the summer of 2001, the CIA, KGB, Pakistan's ISI, and Saudi Arabia's General Intelligence Department all operated directly and secretly in Afghanistan. They primed Afghan factions with cash and weapons, secretly trained guerrilla forces, funded propaganda, and manipulated politics. In the midst of these struggles bin Laden conceived and then built his global organization.  <br><br>  Comprehensively and for the first time, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Steve Coll tells the secret history of the CIA's role in Afghanistan, from its covert program against Soviet troops from 1979 to 1989, to the rise of the Taliban and the emergence of bin Laden, to the secret efforts by CIA officers and their agents to capture or kill bin Laden in Afghanistan after 1998. Based on extensive firsthand accounts, <i>Ghost Wars</i>ok  is the inside story that goes well beyond anything previously published on U.S. involvement in Afghanistan. It chronicles the roles of midlevel CIA officers, their Afghan allies, and top spy masters such as Bill Casey, Saudi Arabia's Prince Turki al Faisal, and George Tenet. And it describes heated debates within the American government and the often poisonous, mistrustful relations between the CIA and foreign intelligence agencies.  <br><br>  <i>Ghost Wars</i> answers the questions so many have asked since the horrors of September 11: To what extent did America's best intelligence analysts grasp the rising threat of Islamist radicalism? Who tried to stop bin Laden and why did they fail?"

Diane McWhorter, journalist and daughter of a prominent Birmingham family, weaves together police and FBI documents, interviews with black activists and former Klansmen, and personal memories into an extraordinary narrative of the city, the personalities, and the events that brought about America's second emancipation.

    - Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan
    - Book
    - Herbert P. Bix
    - "Winner of the Pulitzer Prize<P>In this groundbreaking biography of the Japanese emperor Hirohito, Herbert P. Bix offers the first complete, unvarnished look at the enigmatic leader whose sixty-three-year reign ushered Japan into the modern world. Never before has the full life of this controversial figure been revealed with such clarity and vividness. Bix shows what it was like to be trained from birth for a lone position at the apex of the nation's political hierarchy and as a revered symbol of divine status. Influenced by an unusual combination of the Japanese imperial tradition and a modern scientific worldview, the young emperor gradually evolves into his preeminent role, aligning himself with the growing ultranationalist movement, perpetuating a cult of religious emperor worship, resisting attempts to curb his power, and all the while burnishing his image as a reluctant, passive monarch. Here we see Hirohito as he truly was: a man of strong will and real authority.</P><P>Supported by a vast array of previously untapped primary documents, <I>Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan </I>is perhaps most illuminating in lifting the veil on the mythology surrounding the emperor's impact on the world stage. Focusing closely on Hirohito's interactions with his advisers and successive Japanese governments, Bix sheds new light on the causes of the China War in 1937 and the start of the Asia-Pacific War in 1941. And while conventional wisdom has had it that the nation's increasing foreign aggression was driven and maintained not by the emperor but by an elite group of Japanese militarists, the reality, as witnessed here, is quite different. Bix documents in detail the strong, decisive role Hirohito played in wartime operations, from the takeover of Manchuria in 1931 through the attack on Pearl Harbor and ultimately the fateful decision in 1945 to accede to an unconditional surrender. In fact, the emperor stubbornly prolonged the war effort and then used the horrifying bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together with the Soviet entrance into the war, as his exit strategy from a no-win situation. From the moment of capitulation, we see how American and Japanese leaders moved to justify the retention of Hirohito as emperor by whitewashing his wartime role and reshaping the historical consciousness of the Japanese people. The key to this strategy was Hirohito's alliance with General MacArthur, who helped him maintain his stature and shed his militaristic image, while MacArthur used the emperor as a figurehead to assist him in converting Japan into a peaceful nation. Their partnership ensured that the emperor's image would loom large over the postwar years and later decades, as Japan began to make its way in the modern age and struggled -- as it still does -- to come to terms with its past.</P><P>Until the very end of a career that embodied the conflicting aims of Japan's development as a nation, Hirohito remained preoccupied with politics and with his place in history. <I>Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan</I> provides the definitive account of his rich life and legacy. Meticulously researched and utterly engaging, this book is proof that the history of twentieth-century Japan cannot be understood apart from the life of its most remarkable and enduring leader.</P>"

    - <B>Winner of the 1999 National Book Award for Non-Fiction</B>, finalist for the Lionel Gelber Prize and the Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize, <I>Embracing Defeat</I> is John W. Dower's brilliant examination of Japan in the immediate, shattering aftermath of World War II. Drawing on a vast range of Japanese sources and illustrated with dozens of astonishing documentary photographs, <I>Embracing Defeat</I> is the fullest and most important history of the more than six years of American occupation, which affected every level of Japanese society, often in ways neither side could anticipate. Dower, whom Stephen E. Ambrose has called "America's foremost historian of the Second World War in the Pacific," gives us the rich and turbulent interplay between West and East, the victor and the vanquished, in a way never before attempted, from top-level manipulations concerning the fate of Emperor Hirohito to the hopes and fears of men and women in every walk of life. Already regarded as the benchmark in its field, <I>Embracing Defeat</I> is a work of colossal scholarship and history of the very first order.

    - Book
    - Garry Wills
    - The power of words has rarely been given a more compelling demonstration than in the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln was asked to memorialize the gruesome battle. Instead he gave the whole nation "a new birth of freedom" in the space of a mere 272 words. His entire life and previous training and his deep political experience went into this, his revolutionary masterpiece.<P>By examining both the address and Lincoln in their historical moment and cultural frame, Wills breathes new life into words we thought we knew, and reveals much about a president so mythologized but often misunderstood. Wills shows how Lincoln came to change the world and to effect an intellectual revolution, how his words had to and did complete the work of the guns, and how Lincoln wove a spell that has not yet been broken.

    - <P>  <B>Pulitzer Prize Winner -- and Now an Epic PBS Series</B>  <P>  <I>The Prize</I> recounts the panoramic history of oil -- and the struggle for wealth power that has always surrounded oil. This struggle has shaken the world economy, dictated the outcome of wars, and transformed the destiny of men and nations. <I>The Prize</I> is as much a history of the twentieth century as of the oil industry itself. The canvas of this history is enormous -- from the drilling of the first well in Pennsylvania through two great world wars to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Operation Desert Storm.  <P>  The cast extends from wildcatters and rogues to oil tycoons, and from Winston Churchill and Ibn Saud to George Bush and Saddam Hussein. The definitive work on the subject of oil and a major contribution to understanding our century, <I>The Prize</I> is a book of extraordinary breadth, riveting excitement -- and great importance.

Making up nearly 15% of the entire terrestrial animal biomass, ants are impressive not only in quantitative terms, they also fascinate by their highly organized and complex social system. Their caste system, the division of labor, the origin of altruistic behavior and the complex forms of chemical communication makes them the most interesting group of social organisms and the main subject for sociobiologists. Not least is their ecological importance: Ants are the premier soil turners, channelers of energy and dominatrices of the insect fauna."

    - Dale Maharidge
    - <p>"A stunning sequel to the James AgeeWalker Evans' classic, <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i>. It is at times astonishing, at all times deeply moving."-Studs Terkel</p><p>"A book that reaches into this country's heart of darkness. . . . A tragically human story more telling than a thousand polls. The photographs by Mr. Williamson are eloquent."-Herbert Mitgang, <i>New York Times</i></p><p>"Mr. Williamson's photos are spellbinding and should become instant classics."-John Elvin, <i>Washington Times</i></p><p>In this paperback reissue, an author/photographer team returns to the land and families captured in James Agee and Walker Evans's inimitable masterwork <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i>, extending the project of conscience and chronicling the traumatic decline of King Cotton. In 1936, during a brief window of national attention to the topic, <i>Fortune</i> magazine commissioned from Agee and Evans a story on poverty among tenant farmers in Alabama. Agee was famously ambivalent in his role, calling himself a spy and ultimately delivering a book-length manuscript unpublishable in magazine form. With this continuation of Agee and Evans's work, Maharidge and Williamson not only uncover some surprising historical secrets relating to the families and to Agee himself, but also effectively lay to rest Agee's fear that his work, from lack of reverence or resilience, would be but another offense to the humanity of its subjects.</p><p>Williamson's 90-part photo essay includes updates alongside Evans' classic originals.</p><p><b>Dale Maharidge</b> (<i>Homeland, Journey to Nowhere</i>) has been a visiting professor of journalism at Columbia University and Stanford, and a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1998.</p><p><b>Michael Williamson</b> is a photographer for the <i>Washington Post</i> who won a second Pulitzer for his coverage of the war in Kosovo.</p>

    - The Making of the Atomic Bomb
    - Book
    - Richard Rhodes
    - <P>  Here for the first time, in rich, human, political, and scientific detail, is the complete story of how the bomb was developed, from the turn-of-the-century discovery of the vast energy locked inside the atom to the dropping of the first bombs on Japan.  <P>  Few great discoveries have evolved so swiftly -- or have been so misunderstood. From the theoretical discussions of nuclear energy to the bright glare of Trinity there was a span of hardly more than twenty-five years. What began as merely an interesting speculative problem in physics grew into the Manhattan Project, and then into the Bomb with frightening rapidity, while scientists known only to their peers -- Szilard, Teller, Oppenheimer, Bohr, Meitner, Fermi, Lawrence, and yon Neumann -- stepped from their ivory towers into the limelight.  <P>  Richard Rhodes takes us on that journey step by step, minute by minute, and gives us the definitive story of man's most awesome discovery and invention. <I>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</I> has been compared in its sweep and importance to William L. Shirer's <I>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.</I> It is at once a narrative tour de force and a document as powerful as its subject.

    - Tracy Kidder
    - Computers have changed since 1981, when Tracy Kidder memorably recorded the drama, comedy, and excitement of one companys efforts to bring a new microcomputer to market. What has not changed is the feverish pace of the high-tech industry, the go-for-broke approach to business that has caused so many computer companies to win big (or go belly up), and the cult of pursuing mind-bending technological innovations.

    - "A landmark book from one of the truly original scholars of our time: a magnificent revelation of turn-of-the-century Vienna where out of a crisis of political and social disintegration so much of modern art and thought was born.<P>\"Not only is it a splendid exploration of several aspects of early modernism in their political context; it is an indicator of how the discipline of intellectual history is currently practiced by its most able and ambitious craftsmen. It is also a moving vindication of historical study itself, in the face of modernism's defiant suggestion that history is obsolete.\"<P>-- David A. Hollinger, History Book Club Review<P>\"Each of [the seven separate studies] can be read separately....Yet they are so artfully designed and integrated that one who reads them in order is impressed by the book's wholeness and the momentum of its argument.\"<P>-- Gordon A.

    - Ernest Becker
    - <P> Winner of the Pulitzer prize in 1974 and the culmination of a life's work, <I>The Denial of Death</I> is Ernest Becker's brilliant and impassioned answer to the "why" of human existence. In bold contrast to the predominant Freudian school of thought, Becker tackles the problem of the vital lie -- man's refusal to acknowledge his own mortality. In doing so, he sheds new light on the nature of humanity and issues a call to life and its living that still resonates more than twenty years after its writing.

    - This landmark work, based on Frances FitzGerald's own research and travels, takes us inside Vietnam-into the traditional, ancestor-worshiping villages and the corrupt crowded cities, into the conflicts between Communists and anti-Communists, Catholics and Buddhists, generals and monks -and reveals the country as seen through Vietnamese eyes. With a clarity and authority unrivaled by any book before it or since, Fire in the Lake shows how America utterly and tragically misinterpreted the realities of Vietnam.

    - Book
    - Robert Coles
    - "In the 1950s Robert Coles began studying, living among, and, above all, listening to American children. The results of his efforts--revealed in five volumes published between 1967 and 1977--constitute one of the most searching and vigorous social studies ever undertaken by one person in the United States. Here, heard often in their own voices, are America's \"children of crisis\": African American children caught in the throes of the South's racial integration; The children of impoverished migrant workers in Appalachia; Children whose families were transformed by the migration from South to North, from rural to urban communities; Latino, Native American, and Eskimo children in the poorest communities of the American West; The children of America's wealthiest families confronting the burden of their own privilege. This volume restores to print a masterwork of psychological and sociological inquiry--a book that, in its focus on how children learn and develop in the face of rapid change and social upheaval, speaks directly and pointedly to our own times.

    - "Barbara W. Tuchman won the Pulitzer Prize for Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45 in 1972. She uses the life of Joseph Stilwell, the military attache to China in 1935-39 and commander of United States forces and allied chief of staff to Chiang Kai-shek in 1942-44, to explore the history of China from the revolution of 1911 to the turmoil of World War II, when China's Nationalist government faced attack from Japanese invaders and Communist insurgents. Her story is an account of both American relations with China and the experiences of one of our men on the ground. In the cantankerous but level-headed \"Vinegar Joe,\" Tuchman found a subject who allowed her to perform, in the words of The National Review, \"one of the historian's most envied magic acts: conjoining a fine biography of a man with a fascinating epic story.\""

    - The Breaks of the Game
    - Book
    - David Halberstam
    - <P> "One of the best books I've ever read about American sports!"  <br>--Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, <i>The New York Times</i></P>    <P>Available for the first time in years, David Halberstam's <i>The Breaks of the Game</i> focuses on one grim season (1979-80) in the life of the Portland Trail Blazers, a team that only three years before had been National Basketball Association champions. </p><P><P>As Halberstam follows this collection of men through the months, through the losing streaks and occasional victories, the endless trips and the brutal schedules, we come to know them and their world--the other players, coaches, and owners; the competition, drafts, trades, and traditions; the wives, the fans, the media connections--a world of grand dreams, impossible expectations, and bracing realities.  </p><P><P>The tactile authenticity of Halberstam's knowledge of the basketball world is unrivaled.  Yet he is writing here about far more than just basketball. This is a story about a place in our society where power, money, and talent collide and sometimes corrupt, a place where both national obsessions and naked greed are exposed. It's about the influence of big media, the fans and the hype they subsist on, the clash of ethics, the terrible physical demands of modern sports (from drugs to body size), the unreal salaries, the conflicts of race and class, and the consequences of sport converted into mass entertainment and athletes transformed into superstars--all presented in a way that puts the reader in the room and on the court, and <i>The Breaks of the Game</i> in a league of its own.</p>

    - Geoff Dyer
    - "A wildly original novel of erotic fulfillment and spiritual yearning. <br><br>Every two years the international art world descends on Venice for the opening of the Biennale. Among them is Jeff Atman\xE2\x80\x93a jaded and dissolute journalist\xE2\x80\x93whose dedication to the cause of Bellini-fuelled partygoing is only intermittently disturbed by the obligation to file a story. When he meets the spellbinding Laura, he is rejuvenated, ecstatic. Their romance blossoms quickly, but is it destined to disappear just as rapidly? <br><br>Every day thousands of pilgrims head to the banks of the Ganges at Varanasi, the holiest Hindu city in India. Among their number is a narrator who may or may not be the Atman previously seen in Venice. Intending to visit only for a few days he ends up staying for months, and suddenly finds\xE2\x80\x93or should that be loses?\xE2\x80\x93a hitherto unexamined idea of himself, <i>the </i>self. In a romance he can only observe, he sees a reflection of the kind of pleasures that, willingly or not, he has renounced.  In the process, two ancient and watery cities become versions of each other. Could two stories, in two different cities, actually be one and the same story? <br><br>Nothing Geoff Dyer has written before is as wonderfully unbridled, as dead-on in evocation of place, longing and the possibility of neurotic enlightenment, and as irrepressibly entertaining as <i>Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi.</i><br><i><br></i><br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

    - "The Weight of a Mustard Seed: The Intimate Story of an Iraqi General and His Family During Thirty Years of Tyranny"
    - Book
    - Wendell Steavenson
    - "<p> General Kamel Sachet was a favorite of Saddam Hussein's, a hero of the Iran-Iraq war, head of the army in Kuwait City during Desert Storm, governor of the province of Maysan, and father of nine children. When author Wendell Steavenson became intrigued by his story, she began with a few questions about Sachet and his fellow Baathist loyalists: \"Why had they served such a regime? How had they accommodated their own morality? How had they lived? How had they lived with themselves?\" Her journey to find these answers took five years, and an accumulation of facts, opinions, fears, confessions and suspicions from Sachet's family, friends, and enemies. The result is not just a gripping account of one man's rise and fall, but a vivid and compassionate portrayal of the Iraqi people. </p> <p> As Sachet rose from policeman to Special Forces officer and then General, he made more and more sacrifices to remain in Saddam's good favor. Steadfast in his loyalty to God and his President, Sachet attended military executions and endured his own imprisonment as Saddam's behavior took increasingly paranoiac and power-crazy turns. But when it came time for Sachet's sons to do their military service, he refused to let them join the \"criminal\" organization to which he had given his life. Kamel Sachet realized, too late, that he'd become a participant in the terror regime that had strangled his county and destroyed its people. Through his story and the stories of those around him, Wendell Steavenson shows the choices Iraqis have had to make between exile and collaboration, God and jihad. Here are the Iraqis behind the headlines and the tragedy begotten of unintended consequences. And here is the first full-length narrative from an immensely talented journalist who has already been compared by critics to Bruce Chatwin and Ryszard Kapucinksi. </p>"

    - Shadow Country (Modern Library Paperbacks)
    - Book
    - Peter Matthiessen
    - "<b>2008 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER</b><br><br>Peter Matthiessen\xE2\x80\x99s great American epic\xE2\x80\x93Killing Mister Watson, Lost Man\xE2\x80\x99s River, and Bone by Bone\xE2\x80\x93was conceived as one vast mysterious novel, but because of its length it was originally broken up into three books. In this bold new rendering, Matthiessen has cut nearly a third of the overall text and collapsed the time frame while deepening the insights and motivations of his characters with brilliant rewriting throughout. In <i>Shadow Country,</i> he has marvelously distilled a monumental work, realizing his original vision. <br><br>Inspired by a near-mythic event of the wild Florida frontier at the turn of the twentieth century, Shadow Country reimagines the legend of the inspired Everglades sugar planter and notorious outlaw E. J. Watson, who drives himself relentlessly toward his own violent end at the hands of neighbors who mostly admired him, in a killing that obsessed his favorite son.<br><i><br>Shadow Country</i> traverses strange landscapes and frontier hinterlands inhabited by Americans of every provenance and color, including the black and Indian inheritors of the archaic racism that, as Watson\xE2\x80\x99s wife observed, \"still casts its shadow over the nation.\"<br><br>Peter Matthiessen\xE2\x80\x99s lyrical and illuminating work in the Watson narrative has been praised highly by such contemporaries as Saul Bellow, William Styron, and W. S. Merwin. Joseph Heller said \"I read it in great gulps, up each night later than I wanted to be, in my hungry impatience to find out more and more.\" <br><br><u>Praise for<i> Shadow Country</i></u><br>\xE2\x80\x9C<i>Shadow Country</i> is altogether gripping, shocking, and <b>brilliantly told</b>, not just a tour de force in its stylistic range, but<b> a great American novel, as powerful a reading experience as nearly any in our literature.</b> This magnificent, sad masterpiece about race, history, and defeated dreams can easily stand comparison with Ralph Ellison's <i>Invisible Man</i> and Robert Penn Warren's All <i>the King's Men</i>. Little wonder, too, that parts of the story of E.J. Watson call up comparisons with Dostoevsky, Conrad, and, inevitably, Faulkner<b>. In every way, <i>Shadow Country</i> is a bravura performance, at once history, fiction, and myth\xE2\x80\x93as well as the capstone to the career of one of the most admired and admirable writers of our time</b>.\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x94 <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>\xE2\x80\x9CMagnificent and capacious\xE2\x80\xA6. I'll just say right here that the book took my sleeve and like the ancient mariner would not let go. <b>Matthiessen has made his three-part saga into a new thing\xE2\x80\xA6. Finally now we have these books welded like a bell, and with Watson's song the last sound, all the elements fuse and resonate\xE2\x80\xA6.a breathtaking saga.\xE2\x80\x9D</b> \xE2\x80\x94 <i>The Los Angeles Times<br></i><br>\xE2\x80\x9C<b>Gorgeously written and unfailingly compelling,</b> <b><i>Shadow Country</i> is the exhilarating masterwork of [Matthiessen\xE2\x80\x99s] career, every bit as ambitious as <i>Moby Dick</i></b>.\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x94 <i>National Geographic Adventure</i> magazine<br><br>\xE2\x80\x9CPeter Mattiessen consolidates his <b>epic masterpiece</b> of Florida -- and crafts something even better\xE2\x80\xA6[He] deserves credit for decades of meticulous research and obsessive details and soaring prose that converted the Watson legend into critically acclaimed literature\xE2\x80\xA6.Anyone wanting an explanation for what happened to Florida can now find it in a single novel, <b>a great American novel</b>.\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x94 <i>Miami Herald<br></i><br>\xE2\x80\x9CMatthiessen is writing about one man's life in <i>Shadow Country</i>, but he is also writing about the life of the nation over the course of half a century.

Sorely wounded and fatally disillusioned in the fighting at Petersburg, a Confederate soldier named Inman decides to walk back to his home in the Blue Ridge mountains to Ada, the woman he loves. His trek across the disintegrating South brings him into intimate and sometimes lethal converse with slaves and marauders, bounty hunters and witches, both helpful and malign. At the same time, the intrepid Ada is trying to revive her father\xE2\x80\x99s derelict farm and learning to survive in a world where the old certainties have been swept away.

    - "<B>1996 National Book Award Winner for Fiction.</B> The elegant short fictions gathered hereabout the love of science and the science of love are often set against the backdrop of the nineteenth century. Interweaving historical and fictional characters, they encompass both past and present as they negotiate the complex territory of ambition, failure, achievement, and shattered dreams. In \"Ship Fever,\" the title novella, a young Canadian doctor finds himself at the center of one of history's most tragic epidemics. In \"The English Pupil,\" Linnaeus, in old age, watches as the world he organized within his head slowly drifts beyond his reach. And in \"The Littoral Zone,\" two marine biologists wonder whether their life-altering affair finally was worth it. In the tradition of Alice Munro and William Trevor, these exquisitely rendered fictions encompass whole lives in a brief space. As they move between interior and exterior journeys, \"science is transformed from hard and known fact into malleable, strange and thrilling fictional material\" (Boston Globe). "

    - Book
    - Annie Proulx
    - <P> Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, <I>The Shipping News</I> is a celebration of Annie Proulx's genius for storytelling and her vigorous contribution to the art of the novel. <P> Quoyle, a third-rate newspaper hack, with a "head shaped like a crenshaw, no neck, reddish hair...features as bunched as kissed fingertips," is wrenched violently out of his workaday life when his two-timing wife meets her just deserts. An aunt convinces Quoyle and his two emotionally disturbed daughters to return with her to the starkly beautiful coastal landscape of their ancestral home in Newfoundland. Here, on desolate Quoyle's Point, in a house empty except for a few mementos of the family's unsavory past, the battered members of three generations try to cobble up new lives. <P> Newfoundland is a country of coast and cove where the mercury rarely rises above 70 degrees, the local culinary delicacy is cod cheeks, and it's easier to travel by boat and snowmobile than on anything with wheels. In this harsh place of cruel storms, a collapsing fishery, and chronic unemployment, the aunt sets up as a yacht upholsterer in nearby Killick-Claw, and Quoyle finds a job reporting the shipping news for the local weekly, the <I>Gammy Bird</I> (a paper that specializes in sexual-abuse stories and grisly photos of car accidents). <P> As the long winter closes its jaws of ice, each of the Quoyles confronts private demons, reels from catastrophe to minor triumph -- in the company of the obsequious Mavis Bangs; Diddy Shovel the strongman; drowned Herald Prowse; cane-twirling Beety; Nutbeem, who steals foreign news from the radio; a demented cousin the aunt refuses to recognize; the much-zippered Alvin Yark; silent Wavey; and old Billy Pretty, with his bag of secrets. By the time of the spring storms Quoyle has learned how to gut cod, to escape from a pickle jar, and to tie a true lover's knot.

    - In Saigon during the waning days of the Vietnam War, a small-time journalist named John Converse thinks he'll find action - and profit - by getting involved in a big-time drug deal. But back in the States, things go horribly wrong for him. Dog Soldiers perfectly captures the underground mood of America in the 1970s, when amateur drug dealers and hippies encountered profiteering cops and professional killers - and the price of survival was dangerously high.

Surrounded by men who are jockeying for power\xE2\x80\x93Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, and Mark Antony\xE2\x80\x93young Octavius must work against the powerful Roman political machinations to claim his destiny as first Roman emperor. Sprung from meticulous research and the pen of a true poet, <i>Augustus</i> tells the story of one man\xE2\x80\x99s dream to liberate a corrupt Rome from the fancy of the capriciously crooked and the wildly wealthy."

In a book that the Washington Post called "stylishly maned, tragically songful, and serpentinely elegant," Barth retells these tales from varying perspectives, examining the myths" relationship to reality and their resonance with the contemporary world. A winner of the National Book Award, this feisty, witty, sometimes bawdy book provoked Playboy to comment, "There"s every chance in the world that John Barth is a genius."

    - "Being Dead: A Novel"
    - Book
    - Jim Crace
    - "Lying in the sand dunes of Baritone Bay are the bodies of a middle-aged couple. Celice and Joseph, in their mid-50s and married for more than 30 years, are returning to the seacoast where they met as students. Instead, they are battered to death by a thief with a chunk of granite. Their corpses lie undiscovered and rotting for a week, prey to sand crabs, flies, and gulls. Yet there remains something touching about the scene, with Joseph's hand curving lightly around his wife's leg, \"quietly resting; flesh on flesh; dead, but not departed yet.\" <br><br><i>\"Their bodies had expired, but anyone could tell\xE2\x80\x94just look at them\xE2\x80\x94that Joseph and Celice were still devoted. For while his hand was touching her, curved round her shin, the couple seemed to have achieved that peace the world denies, a period of grace, defying even murder. Anyone who found them there, so wickedly disfigured, would nevertheless be bound to see that something of their love had survived the death of cells. The corpses were surrendered to the weather and the earth, but they were still a man and wife, quietly resting; flesh on flesh; dead, but not departed yet.\"</i><br><br>From that moment forward, <i>Being Dead</i> becomes less about murder and more about death. Alternating chapters move back in time from the murder in hourly and two-hourly increments. As the narrative moves backward, we see Celice and Joseph make the small decisions about their day that will lead them inexorably towards their own deaths. In other chapters the narrative moves forward. Celice and Joseph are on vacation and nobody misses them until they do not return. Thus, it is six days before their bodies are found. Crace describes in minute detail their gradual return to the land with the help of crabs, birds, and the numerous insects that attack the body and gently and not so gently prepare it for the dust-to-dust phase of death.<br>"

    - Motherless Brooklyn
    - Book
    - Jonathan Lethem
    - From America's most inventive novelist, Jonathan Lethem, comes this compelling and compulsive riff on the classic detective novel.<br><br>Lionel Essrog is Brooklyn's very own self-appointed Human Freakshow, an orphan whose Tourettic impulses drive him to bark, count, and rip apart our language in startling and original ways.  Together with three veterans of the St. Vincent's Home for Boys, he works for small-time mobster Frank Minna's limo service cum detective agency. Life without Frank Minna, the charismatic King of Brooklyn, would be unimaginable, so who cares if the tasks he sets them are, well, not exactly legal. But when Frank is fatally stabbed, one of Lionel's colleagues lands in jail, the other two vie for his position, and the victim's widow skips town. Lionel's world is suddenly topsy-turvy, and this outcast who has trouble even conversing attempts to untangle the threads of the case while trying to keep the words straight in his head.  <b>Motherless Brooklyn</b> is a brilliantly original homage to the classic detective novel by one of the most acclaimed writers of his generation.<br>

    - "The Love of a Good Woman : Stories"
    - Book
    - Alice Munro
    - "In eight new stories, a master of the form extends and magnifies her great themes--the vagaries of love, the passion that leads down unexpected paths, the chaos hovering just under the surface of things, and the strange, often comical desires of the human heart.<br><br>Time stretches out in some of the stories: a man and a woman look back forty years to the summer they met--the summer, as it turns out, that the true nature of their lives was revealed. In others time is telescoped: a young girl finds in the course of an evening that the mother she adores, and whose fluttery sexuality she hopes to emulate, will not sustain her--she must count on herself.<br><br>Some choices are made--in a will, in a decision to leave home--with irrevocable and surprising consequences. At other times disaster is courted or barely skirted: when a mother has a startling dream about her baby; when a woman, driving her grandchildren to visit the lakeside haunts of her youth, starts a game that could have dangerous consequences. The rich layering that gives Alice Munro's work so strong a sense of life is particularly apparent in the title story, in which the death of a local optometrist brings an entire town into focus--from the preadolescent boys who find his body, to the man who probably killed him, to the woman who must decide what to do about what she might know. Large, moving, profound--these are stories that extend the limits of fiction."

The product of an East Bronx upbringing by his half-crazy Irish Catholic mother, after his Jewish father left them long ago, Billy is captivated by the world of money, sex, and high society the charismatic Schultz has to offer. But it is also a world of extortion, brutality, and murder, where Billy finds himself involved in a dangerous affair with Schultz's girlfriend.

Now in a Grove paperback edition, The Middleman and Other Stories is a dazzling display of the vision of this important modern writer. An aristocratic Filipina negotiates a new life for herself with an Atlanta investment banker. A Vietnam vet returns to Florida, a place now more foreign than the Asia of his war experience. And in the title story, an Iraqi Jew whose travels have ended in Queens suddenly finds himself an unwitting guerrilla in a South American jungle. Passionate, comic, violent, and tender, these stories draw us into the center of a cultural fusion in the midst of its birth pangs, yet glowing with the energy and exuberance of a society remaking itself.

Wherever they may find themselves, the characters of <b>The Counterlife</b> are tempted unceasingly by the prospect of an alternative existence that can reverse their fate.<br><br>Illuminating these lives in transition and guiding us through the book's evocative landscapes, familiar and foreign, is the miind of the novelist Nathan Zuckerman. His is the skeptical, enveloping intelligence that calculates the price that's paid in the struggle to change personal fortune and reshape history, whether in a dentist's office in suburban New Jersey, or in a tradition-bound English Village in Gloucestershire, or in a church in London's West End, or in a tiny desert settlement in Israel's occupied West Bank.

Since the First Crusade\xE2\x80\x9A there has always been a  George Mills\xE2\x80\x9A who\xE2\x80\x94despite his best efforts\xE2\x80\x94is unable to  improve his position in life or that of his descendants. Instead\xE2\x80\x9A  all the George Millses are forced to accept their lot as true  blue-collar workers\xE2\x80\x9A serving important personages in a series of  odd jobs ranging from horse talker in a salt mine to working as a  furniture mover in contemporary St. Louis. But the latest in the long  line of George Millses may also be the last\xE2\x80\x9A as he obsesses about  his family\xE2\x80\x99s history and determines that he will be the one to break  this doomed cycle of servitude."

    - The Transit of Venus
    - Book
    - Shirley Hazzard
    - "<i>The Transit of Venus</i> is considered Shirley Hazzard's most brilliant novel. It tells the story of two orphan sisters, Caroline and Grace Bell, as they leave Australia to start a new life in post-war England. What happens to these young women--seduction and abandonment, marriage and widowhood, love and betrayal--becomes as moving and wonderful and yet as predestined as the transits of the planets themselves. Gorgeously written and intricately constructed, Hazzard's novel is a story of place: Sydney, London, New York, Stockholm; of time: from the fifties to the eighties; and above all, of women and men in their passage through the displacements and absurdities of modern life. <br><br>\"Engrossing, masterly. . . . Combines the satisfaction of a family saga . . . with a highly structured plot reminiscent of Greek tragedy.\"-- Gail Godwin, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>\"A wonderfully mysterious book. . . . Both plot and characters are many layered. Unforgettably rich.\"-- Anne Tyler, <i>The New Republic</i><br><br>\"Luminous. . . . Almost without flaw. Aphoristic and iridescent, her language turns paragraphs into events.\"-- Webster Schott, <i>The Washington Post Book World</i>"

    - The Year of the French
    - Book
    - Thomas Flanagan
    - In 1798, Irish patriots, committed to freeing their country from England, landed with a company of French troops in County Mayo, in westernmost Ireland. They were supposed to be an advance guard, followed by other French ships with the leader of the rebellion, Wolfe Tone. Briefly they triumphed, raising hopes among the impoverished local peasantry and gathering a group of supporters. But before long the insurgency collapsed before a brutal English counterattack.    <P>Very few books succeed in registering the sudden terrible impact of historical events; Thomas Flanagan's is one. Subtly conceived, masterfully paced, with a wide and memorable cast of characters, <I>The Year of the French</I> brings to life peasants and landlords, Protestants and Catholics, along with old and abiding questions of secular and religious commitments, empire, occupation, and rebellion. It is quite simply a great historical novel.

    - "Milkman Dead was born shortly after a neighborhood eccentric hurled himself off a rooftop in a vain attempt at flight. For the rest of his life he, too, will be trying to fly. With this brilliantly imagined novel, Toni Morrison transfigures the coming-of-age story as audaciously as Saul Bellow or Gabriel Garc\xC3\xADa M\xC3\xA1rquez. As she follows Milkman from his rustbelt city to the place of his family\xE2\x80\x99s origins, Morrison introduces an entire cast of strivers and seeresses, liars and assassins, the inhabitants of a fully realized black world."

    - October Light
    - Book
    - John Gardner
    - <B> Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award. New Directions is excited to reissue the Gardner classics, beginning with <I>October Light</I>, a complex relationship rendered in a down-to-earth narrative.</B><BR><BR><I>October Light</I> is one of John Gardner's masterworks. The penniless widow of a once-wealthy dentist, Sally Abbot now lives in the Vermont farmhouse of her older brother, 72-year-old James Page. Polar opposites in nearly every way, their clash of values turns a bitter corner when the exacting and resolute James takes a shotgun to his sister's color television set. After he locks Sally up in her room with the trashy "blockbuster" novel that has consumed her (and only apples to eat), the novel-within-the-novel becomes an echo chamber providing glimpses into the history of the family that spawned these bizarre, sad, and stubborn people. Gardner uses the turbulent siblings as a stepping-off point from which he expands upon the lives of their extended families, and the rural community that surrounds them. He also engages larger issues of how liberals and conservatives define themselves, and considers those moments when life transcends all their arguments.
