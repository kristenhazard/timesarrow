    - Geraldine Brooks
    - "  From Louisa May Alcott\xE2\x80\x99s beloved classic <I>Little Women</I>, Geraldine Brooks has animated the   character of the absent father, March, and crafted a story \"filled with the ache of love and marriage and   with the power of war upon the mind and heart of one unforgettable man\" (Sue Monk Kidd). With  \"pitch-perfect writing\" (<I>USA Today</I>), Brooks follows March as he leaves behind his family to aid   the Union cause in the Civil War. His experiences will utterly change his marriage and challenge his most   ardently held beliefs. A lushly written, wholly original tale steeped in the details of another time,   <I>March</I> secures Geraldine Brooks\xE2\x80\x99s place as a renowned author of historical fiction."

    - Jeffrey Eugenides
    - "<b>A dazzling triumph from the bestselling author of <i>The Virgin Suicides</i>--the astonishing tale of a gene that passes down through three generations of a Greek-American family and flowers in the body of a teenage girl.</b><br><br>In the spring of 1974, Calliope Stephanides, a student at a girls' school in Grosse Pointe, finds herself drawn to a chain-smoking, strawberry blond clasmate with a gift for acting. The passion that furtively develops between them--along with Callie's failure to develop--leads Callie to suspect that she is not like other girls. In fact, she is not really a girl at all.<br><br>The explanation for this shocking state of affairs takes us out of suburbia- back before the Detroit race riots of 1967, before the rise of the Motor City and Prohibition, to 1922, when the Turks sacked Smyrna and Callie's grandparents fled for their lives. Back to a tiny village in Asia Minor where two lovers, and one rare genetic mutation, set in motion the metamorphosis that will turn Callie into a being both mythical and perfectly real: a hermaphrodite.<br><br>Spanning eight decades--and one unusually awkward adolescence- Jeffrey Eugenides's long-awaited second novel is a grand, utterly original fable of crossed bloodlines, the intricacies of gender, and the deep, untidy promptings of desire. It marks the fulfillment of a huge talent, named one of America's best young novelists by both <i>Granta </i>and <i>The New Yorker</i>.<br>"

Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they don't know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged food\xE2\x80\x94and each other.<br><br><b>The Road</b> is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, \"each the other's world entire,\" are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation."

    - <p> One of the most acclaimed novels in recent memory, <i>The Known World</i> is a daring and ambitious work by Pulitzer Prize winner Edward P. Jones. </p> <p> <i>The Known World</i> tells the story of Henry Townsend, a black farmer and former slave who falls under the tutelage of William Robbins, the most powerful man in Manchester County, Virginia. Making certain he never circumvents the law, Townsend runs his affairs with unusual discipline.

    - "Twenty-four years after her first novel, <I>Housekeeping</I>, Marilynne Robinson returns with an intimate tale of three generations from the Civil War to the twentieth century: a story about fathers and sons and the spiritual battles that still rage at America's heart. Writing in the tradition of Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, Marilynne Robinson's beautiful, spare, and spiritual prose allows \"even the faithless reader to feel the possibility of transcendent order\" (<I>Slate</I>). In the luminous and unforgettable voice of Congregationalist minister John Ames, Gilead reveals the human condition and the often unbearable beauty of an ordinary life."

    - Book
    - Sidney Poitier
    - "\"I have no wish to play the pontificating fool, pretending that I\xE2\x80\x99ve suddenly come up with the answers to all life\xE2\x80\x99s questions. Quite that contrary, I began this book as an exploration, an exercise in self-questing. In other words, I wanted to find out, as I looked back at a long and complicated life, with many twists and turns, how well I\xE2\x80\x99ve done at measuring up to the values I myself have set.\"  <BR>--Sidney Poitier    <P>In this luminous memoir, a true American icon looks back on his celebrated life and career. His body of work is arguably the most morally significant in cinematic history, and the power and influence of that work are indicative of the character of the man behind the many storied roles. Sidney Poitier here explores these elements of character and personal values to take his own measure -- as a man, as a husband and a father, and as an actor.    <P>Poitier credits his parents and his childhood on tiny Cat Island in the Bahamas for equipping him with the unflinching sense of right and wrong and of self-worth that he has never surrendered and that have dramatically shaped his world. \"In the kind of place where I grew up,\" recalls Poitier, \"what\xE2\x80\x99s coming at you is the sound of the sea and the smell of the wind and momma\xE2\x80\x99s voice and the voice of your dad and the craziness of your brothers and sisters \xE2\x80\xA6 and that\xE2\x80\x99s it.\" Without television, radio, and material distractions to obscure what matters most, he could enjoy the simple things, endure the long commitments, and find true meaning in his life.    <P>Poitier was uncompromising as he pursued a personal and public life that would honor his upbringing and the invaluable legacy of his parents. Just a few years after his introduction to indoor plumbing and the automobile, Poitier broke racial barrier after racial barrier to launch a pioneering acting career. Committed to the notion that what one does for a living articulates to who one is, Poitier played only forceful and affecting characters who said something positive, useful, and lasting about the human condition.    <P>Here is Poitier\xE2\x80\x99s own introspective look at what has informed his performances and his life. Poitier explores the nature of sacrifice and commitment, price and humility, rage and forgiveness, and paying the price for artistic integrity. What emerges is a picture of a man in the face of limits \xE2\x80\x93 his own and the world\xE2\x80\x99s. A triumph of the spirit, <I>The Measure of a Man</i> captures the essential Poitier."

    - The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (Oprah's Book Club)
    - Book
    - Carson McCullers
    - With the publication of her first novel, THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER,  Carson McCullers, all of twenty-three, became a literary  sensation. With its profound sense of moral isolation and its  compassionate glimpses into its characters' inner lives, the novel is  considered McCullers' finest work, an enduring masterpiece first  published by Houghton Mifflin in 1940. At its center is the deaf-mute  John Singer, who becomes the confidant for all various types of  misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for  escape from small town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane,  Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's  heroine (and loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her  music. Wonderfully attune to the spiritual isolation that underlies  the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the  South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives  voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated -- and,  through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal  search for beauty.<BR> Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her  ability "to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace  white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness."  She writes "with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming," said  the NEW YORK TIMES. McCullers became an overnight literary sensation,  but her novel has endured, just as timely and powerful today as when  it was first published. THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER is Carson  McCullers at her most compassionate, endearing best.

    - "<p>One of the 20th century's enduring works, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize\xE2\x80\x93winning career.</p> <p>The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buend\xC3\xADa family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buend\xC3\xADa family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America.</p> <p>Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel Garc\xC3\xADa M\xC3\xA1rquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.</p> <p>Alternately reverential and comical, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.</p>"

    - <I>Night</I> is Elie Wiesel's masterpiece, a candid, horrific, and deeply  poignant autobiographical account of his survival as a teenager in the  Nazi death camps. This new translation by Marion Weisel, Elie's wife  and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language  and spirit truest to the author's original intent.  And in the  substantive new preface, Elie Wiesel reflects on the enduring  importance of <I>Night</I> and his lifelong, passionate dedication to  ensuring that the world never forgets man capacity for inhumanity to  man.    <P><I>Night</I> offers much more than a litany of the daily terrors, everyday  perversions, and rampant sadism at Auschwitz and Buchenwald; it also  eloquently addresses many of the philosophical as well as personal  questions implicit in any serious consideration of what the Holocaust  was, what it meant, and what its legacy is and will be.

    - Part One Of Three Parts    <P>A love story, an adventure, an American epic, LONESOME DOVE embraces all the West -- legend and fact, heroes and outlaws, whores and ladies, Indians and settlers -- in a novel that recreates the central American experience, the most enduring of our national myths.    <P>Set in the late 19th century, LONESOME DOVE is the story of a cattle drive from Texas to Montana -- and much more.  The drive is a risk, sure, but it's a part of the American Dream, a chance to carve a new life out of the last remaining wilderness.    <P>"Once again, McMurtry spins a yarn about the West -- and also about the nature of friendship, of folly, of responsibility, of moral codes and men and their destinies." (The Wall Street Journal)

In <i>The March</i>, he dreams himself backward from <i>The Book of Daniel</i> to <i>Ragtime</i> to <i>The Waterworks</i> to the Civil War, into the creation myth of the Republic itself, as if to assume the prophetic role of such nineteenth-century writers as Emerson, Melville, Whitman, and Poe.\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x93John Leonard, <i>Harper\xE2\x80\x99s</i><br><br>In 1864, Union general William Tecumseh Sherman marched his sixty thousand troops through Georgia to the sea, and then up into the Carolinas.

    - Jhumpa Lahiri
    - Navigating between the Indian traditions they've inherited and the baffling new world, the characters in Jhumpa Lahiri's elegant, touching stories seek love beyond the barriers of culture and generations. In "A Temporary Matter," published in The New Yorker, a young Indian-American couple faces the heartbreak of a stillborn birth while their Boston neighborhood copes with a nightly blackout. In the title story, an interpreter guides an American family through the India of their ancestors and hears an astonishing confession. Lahiri writes with deft cultural insight reminiscent of Anita Desai and a nuanced depth that recalls Mavis Gallant. She is an important and powerful new voice.

    - Philip Roth
    - "As the American century draws to an uneasy close, Philip Roth gives us a novel of unqualified greatness that is an elegy for all our century's promises of prosperity, civic order,  and domestic bliss. Roth's protagonist is Swede Levov, a legendary athlete at his Newark high school, who grows up in the booming postwar years to marry a former Miss New Jersey, inherit his father's glove factory, and move into a stone house in the idyllic hamlet of Old Rimrock. And then one day in 1968, Swede's beautiful American luck deserts him.<br><br>For Swede's adored daughter, Merry, has grown from a loving, quick-witted girl into a sullen, fanatical teenager\xE2\x80\x94a teenager capable of an outlandishly savage act of political terrorism. And overnight Swede is wrenched out of the longer-for American pastoral and into the indigenous American berserk. Compulsively readable, propelled by sorrow, rage, and a deep compassion for its characters, this is Roth's masterpiece."

In <I>The Good Earth</I> she presents a graphic view of a China when the last emperor reigned and the vast political and social upheavals of the twentieth century were but distant rumblings for the ordinary people. This moving, classic story of the honest farmer Wang Lung and his selfless wife O-lan is must reading for those who would fully appreciate the sweeping changes that have occurred in the lives of the Chinese people during this century. <P> Nobel Prize winner Pearl S. Buck traces the whole cycle of life: its terrors, its passions, its ambitions and rewards. Her brilliant novel -- beloved by millions of readers -- is a universal tale of the destiny of man."

    - Book
    - Annie Proulx
    - <P> Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, <I>The Shipping News</I> is a celebration of Annie Proulx's genius for storytelling and her vigorous contribution to the art of the novel. <P> Quoyle, a third-rate newspaper hack, with a "head shaped like a crenshaw, no neck, reddish hair...features as bunched as kissed fingertips," is wrenched violently out of his workaday life when his two-timing wife meets her just deserts. An aunt convinces Quoyle and his two emotionally disturbed daughters to return with her to the starkly beautiful coastal landscape of their ancestral home in Newfoundland. Here, on desolate Quoyle's Point, in a house empty except for a few mementos of the family's unsavory past, the battered members of three generations try to cobble up new lives. <P> Newfoundland is a country of coast and cove where the mercury rarely rises above 70 degrees, the local culinary delicacy is cod cheeks, and it's easier to travel by boat and snowmobile than on anything with wheels. In this harsh place of cruel storms, a collapsing fishery, and chronic unemployment, the aunt sets up as a yacht upholsterer in nearby Killick-Claw, and Quoyle finds a job reporting the shipping news for the local weekly, the <I>Gammy Bird</I> (a paper that specializes in sexual-abuse stories and grisly photos of car accidents). <P> As the long winter closes its jaws of ice, each of the Quoyles confronts private demons, reels from catastrophe to minor triumph -- in the company of the obsequious Mavis Bangs; Diddy Shovel the strongman; drowned Herald Prowse; cane-twirling Beety; Nutbeem, who steals foreign news from the radio; a demented cousin the aunt refuses to recognize; the much-zippered Alvin Yark; silent Wavey; and old Billy Pretty, with his bag of secrets. By the time of the spring storms Quoyle has learned how to gut cod, to escape from a pickle jar, and to tie a true lover's knot.

    - Leo Tolstoy
    - <I>Anna Karenina</I> tells of the doomed love affair between the  sensuous and rebellious Anna and the dashing officer, Count  Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and  must endure the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and richly  textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major  characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of  city and country life and all the variations on love and family  happiness.  While previous versions have softened the robust, and  sometimes shocking, quality of Tolstoy's writing, Pevear and  Volokhonsky have produced a translation true to his powerful  voice. This award-winning team's authoritative edition also includes  an illuminating introduction and explanatory notes. Beautiful,  vigorous, and eminently readable, this <I>Anna Karenina</I> will be  the definitive text for generations to come.

    - The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter
    - Book
    - Carson McCullers
    - With the publication of her first novel, THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER,  Carson McCullers, all of twenty-three, became a literary  sensation. With its profound sense of moral isolation and its  compassionate glimpses into its characters' inner lives, the novel is  considered McCullers' finest work, an enduring masterpiece first  published by Houghton Mifflin in 1940. At its center is the deaf-mute  John Singer, who becomes the confidant for all various types of  misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for  escape from small town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane,  Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's  heroine (and loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her  music. Wonderfully attune to the spiritual isolation that underlies  the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the  South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives  voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated -- and,  through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal  search for beauty.<BR> Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her  ability "to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace  white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness."  She writes "with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming," said  the NEW YORK TIMES. McCullers became an overnight literary sensation,  but her novel has endured, just as timely and powerful today as when  it was first published. THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER is Carson  McCullers at her most compassionate, endearing best.

    - "<p>One of the 20th century's enduring works, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize\xE2\x80\x93winning career.</p> <p>The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buend\xC3\xADa family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buend\xC3\xADa family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America.</p> <p>Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel Garc\xC3\xADa M\xC3\xA1rquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.</p> <p>Alternately reverential and comical, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.</p>"

    - <i>Cry, the Beloved Country</i> is a beautifully told and profoundly  compassionate story of the Zulu pastor Stephen Kumalo and his son  Absalom, set in the troubled and changing South Africa of the 1940s.    The book is written with such keen empathy and understanding that to  read it is to share fully in the gravity of the characters'  situations. It both touches your heart deeply and inspires a renewed  faith in the dignity of mankind. Cry, the Beloved Country is a classic  tale, passionately African, timeless and universal, and beyond all,  selfless.

    - Toni Morrison's first novel, <b>The Bluest Eye</b> (1970), was acclaimed as the work of an important talent, written--as John Leonard said in <i>The New York Times</i>--in a prose "so precise, so faithful to speech and so charged with pain and wonder that the novel becomes poetry."<br><br><b>Sula</b> has the same power, the same beauty.<br><br>At its center--a friendship between two women, a friendship whose intensity first sustains, then injures. Sula and Nel--both black, both smart, both poor, raised in a small Ohio town--meet when they are twelve, wishbone thin and dreaming of princes.<br><br>Through their girlhood years they share everything--perceptions, judgments, yearnings, secrets, even crime--until Sula gets out, out of the Bottom, the hilltop neighborhood where beneath the sporting life of the men hanging around the place in headrags and soft felt hats there hides a fierce resentment at failed crops, lost jobs, thieving insurance men, bug-ridden flour...at the invisible line that cannot be overstepped.  <br><br>Sula leaps it and roams the cities of America for ten years. Then she returns to the town, to her friend. But Nel is a wife now, settled with her man and her three children. She belongs. She accommodates to the Bottom, where you avoid the hand of God by getting in it, by staying <i>upright,</i> helping out at church suppers, asking after folks--where you deal with evil by surviving it.  <br><br>Not Sula. As willing to feel pain as to give pain, she can never accommodate. Nel can't understand her any more, and the others never did. Sula scares them. Mention her now, and they recall that she put her grandma in an old folks' home (the old lady who let a train take her leg for the insurance)...that a child drowned in the river years ago...that there was a plague of robins when she first returned...<br><br>In clear, dark, resonant language, Toni Morrison brilliantly evokes not only a bond between two lives, but the harsh, loveless, ultimately mad world in which that bond is destroyed, the world of the Bottom and its people, through forty years, up to the time of their bewildered realization that even more than they feared Sula, their pariah, they needed her.

    - With a compassionate realism and narrative sweep that recall the work of Charles Dickens, this magnificent novel captures all the cruelty and corruption, dignity and heroism, of India. The time is 1975. The place is an unnamed city by the sea. The government has just declared a State of Emergency, in whose upheavals four strangers--a spirited widow, a young student uprooted from his idyllic hill station, and two tailors who have fled the caste violence of their native village--will be thrust together, forced to share one cramped apartment and an uncertain future. <br><br>As the characters move from distrust to friendship and from friendship to love, <b>A Fine Balance</b> creates an enduring panorama of the human spirit in an inhuman state.

    - Book
    - Gwyn Hyman Rubio
    - In the tradition of <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> and <i>The Cape Ann</i>, a funny, sad, wise, and redeeming first novel about a young girl's battle with a troubling affliction.  Rural Kentucky in the 1950s is not an easy place to grow up in, and it's especially hard for 10-year-old Icy Sparks, an orphan who lives with her grandparents. Life becomes even more difficult for Icy when the violent tics and uncontrollable cursing begin. Icy's adolescence is marred by the humiliation brought on by her mysterious condition, and its all-too-visible symptoms are the source of endless hilarity as everyone around her offers an opinion about what's troubling the girl. Eventually, Icy finds solace in the company of an obese woman who knows what it's like to be an outcast in this tightly knit Appalachian community. Narrated by a now-grown Icy, this first novel shimmers with warmth and humor as it recounts a young girl's painful and poignant journey to womanhood--and the many lives she touches and enriches along the way.<br> <br>--<i>Icy Sparks</i> was a <i>New York Times</i> Editor's Choice <br> <br>"Awesomely intelligent . . . Robinson's accurate but unstuffy writing has done much to popularize wine and make it accessible to new drinkers." --<i>The Guardian</i> (London)

    - "\"Elegant and powerful...an unusual and  volatile...literary thriller.\"  --<i>Washington Post Book  World</i><br><br><br>In this riveting novel of almost unbearable  suspense, three fragile yet determined people become dangerously  entangled in a relentlessly escalating crisis. Colonel Behrani, once a  wealthy man in Iran, is now a struggling immigrant willing to bet  everything he has to restore his family's dignity. Kathy Niccolo is a  recovering alcoholic and addict whose house is all she has left, and  who refuses to let her hard-won stability slip away from her. Sheriff  Lester Burdon, a married man who finds himself falling in love with  Kathy, becomes obsessed with helping her fight for  justice.<br><br>Drawn by their competing desires to the same small  house in the California hills--and what it represents to each of  them--and doomed by their tragic inability to understand one another,  the three converge on an explosive collision course. Combining  unadorned realism with profound empathy, <b>House of Sand and Fog</b>  is a devastating exploration of the American Dream gone awry."

    - "In this superb novel by the beloved author of Talk Before Sleep, The Pull of the Moon, and Until the Real Thing Comes Along, a woman re-creates her life after divorce by opening up her house and her heart.<br>Samantha's husband has left her, and after a spree of overcharging at Tiffany's, she settles down to reconstruct a life for herself and her eleven-year-old son. Her eccentric mother tries to help by fixing her up with dates, but a more pressing problem is money. To meet her mortgage payments, Sam decides to take in boarders. The first is an older woman who offers sage advice and sorely needed comfort; the second, a maladjusted student, is not quite so helpful. A new friend, King, an untraditional man, suggests that Samantha get out, get going, get work. But her real work is this: In order to emerge from grief and the past, she has to learn how to make her own happiness. In order to really see people, she has to look within her heart. And in order to know who she is, she has to remember--and reclaim--the person she used to be, long before she became someone else in an effort to save her marriage. Open House is a love story about what can blossom between a man and a woman, and within a woman herself.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

    - Toni Morrison
    - "\"They shoot the white girl first. With the others they can take their time.\" Toni Morrison's first novel since she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature opens with a horrifying scene of mob violence then chronicles its genesis in a small all-black town in rural Oklahoma. Founded by descendants of free slaves as intent on isolating themselves from the outside world as it once was on rejecting them, the patriarchal community of Ruby is built on righteousness, rigidly enforced moral law, and fear. But seventeen miles away, another group of exiles has gathered in a promised land of their own. And it is upon these women in flight from death and despair that nine male citizens of Ruby will lay their pain, their terror, and their murderous rage... <P> Paradise is a tour de force of storytelling power, richly imagined and elegantly composed. Morrison challenges our most fiercely held beliefs as she weaves folklore and history, memory and myth, into an unforgettable meditation on race, religion, gender, and the way a society can turn on itself until it is forced to explode."

    - Stones from the River
    - Book
    - Ursula Hegi
    - <I>Stones from the River</I> is a daring, dramatic and complex novel of life in Germany. It is set in Burgdorf, a small fictional German town, between 1915 and 1951. The protagonist is Trudi Montag, a Zwerg -- the German word for dwarf woman. As a dwarf she is set apart, the outsider whose physical "otherness" has a corollary in her refusal to be a part of Burgdorf's silent complicity during and after World War II. Trudi establishes her status and power, not through beauty, marriage, or motherhood, but rather as the town's librarian and relentless collector of stories.  <P>Through Trudi's unblinking eyes, we witness the growing impact of Nazism on the ordinary townsfolk of Burgdorf as they are thrust on to a larger moral stage and forced to make choices that will forever mark their lives. <I>Stones from the River</I> is a story of secrets, parceled out masterfully by Trudi -- and by Ursula Hegi -- as they reveal the truth about living through unspeakable times.

    - <P> In this extraordinary coming-of-age odyssey, Wally Lamb invites us to hitch a wild ride on a journey of love, pain, and renewal with the most heartbreakingly comical heroine to come along in years. <P> Meet Dolores Price.  She's 13, wise-mouthed but wounded, having bid her childhood goodbye.  Stranded in front of her bedroom TV, she spends the next few years nourishing herself with the Mallomars, potato chips, and Pepsi her anxious mother supplies.  When she finally orbits into young womanhood at 257 pounds, Dolores is no stronger and life is no kinder.  But this time she's determined to rise to the occasion and give herself one more chance before she <I>really</I> goes under.

    - "Milkman Dead was born shortly after a neighborhood eccentric hurled himself off a rooftop in a vain attempt at flight. For the rest of his life he, too, will be trying to fly. With this brilliantly imagined novel, Toni Morrison transfigures the coming-of-age story as audaciously as Saul Bellow or Gabriel Garc\xC3\xADa M\xC3\xA1rquez. As she follows Milkman from his rustbelt city to the place of his family\xE2\x80\x99s origins, Morrison introduces an entire cast of strivers and seeresses, liars and assassins, the inhabitants of a fully realized black world."

    - The Executioner's Song
    - Book
    - Norman Mailer
    - "Winner of the 1980 Pulitzer Prize<br><br>In what is arguably his greatest book, America's most heroically ambitious writer follows<br>the short, blighted career of Gary Gilmore, an intractably violent product of America's<br>prisons who became notorious for two reasons: first, for robbing two men in 1976, then<br>killing them in cold blood; and, second, after being tried and convicted, for insisting on<br>dying for his crime. To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on<br>keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death.<br><br>Norman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his<br>procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a<br>restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. The<br>Executioner's Song is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of<br>American loneliness and violence. It is a towering achievement--impossible to put down, impossible to forget."

Extraordinary family lore has been passed down to Abigail Howland, but not all of it. When shocking facts come to light about her late grandfather William\xE2\x80\x99s relationship with Margaret Carmichael, a black housekeeper, the community is outraged, and quickly gathers to vent its fury on Abigail. Alone in the house the Howlands built, she is at once shaken by those who have betrayed her, and determined to punish the town that has persecuted her and her kin. <br><br>Morally intricate, graceful and suspenseful, <b>The Keepers of the House</b> has become a modern classic."

A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father -- a crusading local lawyer -- risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.</p>

    - Book
    - Ernest Hemingway
    - <P> <I>The Old Man and the Sea</I> is one of Hemingway's most enduring works. Told in language of great simplicity and power, it is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, down on his luck, and his supreme ordeal -- a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Here Hemingway recasts, in strikingly contemporary style, the classic theme of courage in the face of defeat, of personal triumph won from loss. Written in 1952, this hugely successful novella confirmed his power and presence in the literary world and played a large part in his winning the 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature.

With THE WAY WEST, he pays homage to the grandeur of the western wilderness, its stark and beautiful scenery, and its extraordinary people.

    - James Gould Cozzens
    - "<i>Guard of Honor</i> is a neglected masterpiece that stands comparison with the greatest novels of the Second World War--essayist Noel Perrin deemed it \"probably the best war novel of the twentieth century.\"<br>\t<br>James Gould Cozzens's <i>Guard of Honor</i> won the Pulitzer Prize in 1949. The novel balances a vast cast of intricately enmeshed characters as they react over the course of three tense days in September 1943 to a racial incident on a U.S. Army airbase in Florida. The reader is acutely aware of the war raging abroad and the effect it has had, or will have, on the multitude of servicemen who populate Cozzens's immense canvas. As Noel Perrin commented in <i>The Washington Post Book World:</i> \"There is material for two or three hundred movies in <i>Guard of Honor</i>.\"<br>\t<br>\"No other American novelist of our time writes with such profound understanding of the wellsprings of human character and of the social pressures that help to form it,\" said Orville Prescott in <i>The New York Times</i>. As Brendan Gill observed in <i>The New Yorker</i>: \"Every page of <i>Guard of Honor</i> gives the impression of a writer at the very top of his powers setting out to accomplish nothing less than his masterwork.\""

Blackmon unearths the lost stories of slaves and their descendants who journeyed into freedom after the Emancipation Proclamation and then back into the shadow of involuntary servitude shortly thereafter. By turns moving, sobering, and shocking, this unprecedented account reveals the stories of those who fought unsuccessfully against the re-emergence of human labor trafficking, the companies that profited most from neoslavery, and the insidious legacy of racism that reverberates today."

    - "<p> The enactment of the German extermination policies that resulted in the murder of six million European Jews depended upon many factors, including the cooperation of local authorities and police departments, and the passivity of the populations, primarily of their political and spiritual elites. Necessary also was the victims' willingness to submit, often with the hope of surviving long enough to escape the German vise. <i>The Years of Extermination</i>, the completion of Saul Friedl\xC3\xA4nder's major historical opus on Nazi Germany and the Jews, explores the convergence of the various aspects of this most systematic and sustained of modern genocides. In this unparalleled work\xE2\x80\x94based on a vast array of documents and an overwhelming choir of voices from diaries, letters, and memoirs\xE2\x80\x94the history of the Holocaust has found its definitive representation. </p>"

    - Book
    - Caroline Elkins
    - <b>A major work of history that for the first time reveals the violence and terror at the heart of Britain's civilizing mission in Kenya</b><br><br>As part of the Allied forces, thousands of Kenyans fought alongside the British in World War II. But just a few years after the defeat of Hitler, the British colonial government detained nearly the entire population of Kenya's largest ethnic minority, the Kikuyu-some one and a half million people.<br><br>The compelling story of the system of prisons and work camps where thousands met their deaths has remained largely untold-the victim of a determined effort by the British to destroy all official records of their attempts to stop the Mau Mau uprising, the Kikuyu people's ultimately successful bid for Kenyan independence. <br><br>Caroline Elkins, an assistant professor of history at Harvard University, spent a decade in London, Nairobi, and the Kenyan countryside interviewing hundreds of Kikuyu men and women who survived the British camps, as well as the British and African loyalists who detained them. <br><br>The result is an unforgettable account of the unraveling of the British colonial empire in Kenya-a pivotal moment in twentieth- century history with chilling parallels to America's own imperial project.<br>

    - Book
    - Steve Coll
    - "From the managing editor of the <i>Washington Post</i>, a news-breaking account of the CIA's involvement in the covert wars in Afghanistan that fueled Islamic militancy and gave rise to bin Laden's al Qaeda.  <br><br>  For nearly the past quarter century, while most Americans were unaware, Afghanistan has been the playing field for intense covert operations by U.S. and foreign intelligence agencies-invisible wars which sowed the seeds of the September 11 attacks and which provide its context. From the Soviet invasion in 1979 through the summer of 2001, the CIA, KGB, Pakistan's ISI, and Saudi Arabia's General Intelligence Department all operated directly and secretly in Afghanistan. They primed Afghan factions with cash and weapons, secretly trained guerrilla forces, funded propaganda, and manipulated politics. In the midst of these struggles bin Laden conceived and then built his global organization.  <br><br>  Comprehensively and for the first time, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Steve Coll tells the secret history of the CIA's role in Afghanistan, from its covert program against Soviet troops from 1979 to 1989, to the rise of the Taliban and the emergence of bin Laden, to the secret efforts by CIA officers and their agents to capture or kill bin Laden in Afghanistan after 1998. Based on extensive firsthand accounts, <i>Ghost Wars</i>ok  is the inside story that goes well beyond anything previously published on U.S. involvement in Afghanistan. It chronicles the roles of midlevel CIA officers, their Afghan allies, and top spy masters such as Bill Casey, Saudi Arabia's Prince Turki al Faisal, and George Tenet. And it describes heated debates within the American government and the often poisonous, mistrustful relations between the CIA and foreign intelligence agencies.  <br><br>  <i>Ghost Wars</i> answers the questions so many have asked since the horrors of September 11: To what extent did America's best intelligence analysts grasp the rising threat of Islamist radicalism? Who tried to stop bin Laden and why did they fail?"

In this magisterial and acclaimed history, Anne Applebaum offers the first fully documented portrait of the Gulag, from its origins in the Russian Revolution, through its expansion under Stalin, to its collapse in the era of glasnost. Applebaum intimately re-creates what life was like in the camps and links them to the larger history of the Soviet Union. Immediately recognized as a landmark and long-overdue work of scholarship, <b>Gulag</b> is an essential book for anyone who wishes to understand the history of the twentieth century.

    - <P> "The Year of Birmingham," 1963, was a cataclysmic turning point in America's long civil rights struggle. That spring, child demonstrators faced down police dogs and fire hoses in huge nonviolent marches for desegregation. A few months later, Ku Klux Klansmen retaliated by bombing the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church and killing four young black girls. Diane McWhorter, journalist and daughter of a prominent Birmingham family, weaves together police and FBI documents, interviews with black activists and former Klansmen, and personal memories into an extraordinary narrative of the city, the personalities, and the events that brought about America's second emancipation.

    - Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan
    - Book
    - Herbert P. Bix
    - "Winner of the Pulitzer Prize<P>In this groundbreaking biography of the Japanese emperor Hirohito, Herbert P. Bix offers the first complete, unvarnished look at the enigmatic leader whose sixty-three-year reign ushered Japan into the modern world. Never before has the full life of this controversial figure been revealed with such clarity and vividness. Bix shows what it was like to be trained from birth for a lone position at the apex of the nation's political hierarchy and as a revered symbol of divine status. Influenced by an unusual combination of the Japanese imperial tradition and a modern scientific worldview, the young emperor gradually evolves into his preeminent role, aligning himself with the growing ultranationalist movement, perpetuating a cult of religious emperor worship, resisting attempts to curb his power, and all the while burnishing his image as a reluctant, passive monarch. Here we see Hirohito as he truly was: a man of strong will and real authority.</P><P>Supported by a vast array of previously untapped primary documents, <I>Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan </I>is perhaps most illuminating in lifting the veil on the mythology surrounding the emperor's impact on the world stage. Focusing closely on Hirohito's interactions with his advisers and successive Japanese governments, Bix sheds new light on the causes of the China War in 1937 and the start of the Asia-Pacific War in 1941. And while conventional wisdom has had it that the nation's increasing foreign aggression was driven and maintained not by the emperor but by an elite group of Japanese militarists, the reality, as witnessed here, is quite different. Bix documents in detail the strong, decisive role Hirohito played in wartime operations, from the takeover of Manchuria in 1931 through the attack on Pearl Harbor and ultimately the fateful decision in 1945 to accede to an unconditional surrender. In fact, the emperor stubbornly prolonged the war effort and then used the horrifying bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together with the Soviet entrance into the war, as his exit strategy from a no-win situation. From the moment of capitulation, we see how American and Japanese leaders moved to justify the retention of Hirohito as emperor by whitewashing his wartime role and reshaping the historical consciousness of the Japanese people. The key to this strategy was Hirohito's alliance with General MacArthur, who helped him maintain his stature and shed his militaristic image, while MacArthur used the emperor as a figurehead to assist him in converting Japan into a peaceful nation. Their partnership ensured that the emperor's image would loom large over the postwar years and later decades, as Japan began to make its way in the modern age and struggled -- as it still does -- to come to terms with its past.</P><P>Until the very end of a career that embodied the conflicting aims of Japan's development as a nation, Hirohito remained preoccupied with politics and with his place in history. <I>Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan</I> provides the definitive account of his rich life and legacy. Meticulously researched and utterly engaging, this book is proof that the history of twentieth-century Japan cannot be understood apart from the life of its most remarkable and enduring leader.</P>"

    - John W. Dower
    - <B>Winner of the 1999 National Book Award for Non-Fiction</B>, finalist for the Lionel Gelber Prize and the Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize, <I>Embracing Defeat</I> is John W. Dower's brilliant examination of Japan in the immediate, shattering aftermath of World War II. Drawing on a vast range of Japanese sources and illustrated with dozens of astonishing documentary photographs, <I>Embracing Defeat</I> is the fullest and most important history of the more than six years of American occupation, which affected every level of Japanese society, often in ways neither side could anticipate. Dower, whom Stephen E. Ambrose has called "America's foremost historian of the Second World War in the Pacific," gives us the rich and turbulent interplay between West and East, the victor and the vanquished, in a way never before attempted, from top-level manipulations concerning the fate of Emperor Hirohito to the hopes and fears of men and women in every walk of life. Already regarded as the benchmark in its field, <I>Embracing Defeat</I> is a work of colossal scholarship and history of the very first order.

With the arrival of the cigarette in the late-nineteenth century, smoking changes from a luxury and occasional pastime to an everyday -- to some, indispensable -- habit, aided markedly by the exuberance of the tobacco huskers.<br><br>This free-enterprise success saga grows shadowed, from the middle of this century, as science begins to understand the cigarette's toxicity. Ironically the more detailed and persuasive the findings by medical investigators, the more cigarette makers prosper by seeming to modify their product with filters and reduced dosages of tar and nicotine.<br><br>We see the tobacco manufacturers come under intensifying assault as a rogue industry for knowingly and callously plying their hazardous wares while insisting that the health charges against them (a) remain unproven, and (b) are universally understood, so smokers indulge at their own risk.<br><br>Among the eye-opening disclosures here: outrageous pseudo-scientific claims made for cigarettes throughout the '30s and '40s, and the story of how the tobacco industry and the National Cancer Institute spent millions to develop a \"safer\" cigarette that was never brought to market.<br><br>Dealing with an emotional subject that has generated more heat than light, this book is a dispassionate tour de force that examines the nature of the companies' culpability, the complicity of society as a whole, and the shaky moral ground claimed by smokers who are now demanding recompense"

    - Book
    - Garry Wills
    - The power of words has rarely been given a more compelling demonstration than in the Gettysburg Address. Lincoln was asked to memorialize the gruesome battle. Instead he gave the whole nation "a new birth of freedom" in the space of a mere 272 words. His entire life and previous training and his deep political experience went into this, his revolutionary masterpiece.<P>By examining both the address and Lincoln in their historical moment and cultural frame, Wills breathes new life into words we thought we knew, and reveals much about a president so mythologized but often misunderstood. Wills shows how Lincoln came to change the world and to effect an intellectual revolution, how his words had to and did complete the work of the guns, and how Lincoln wove a spell that has not yet been broken.

    - <P>  <B>Pulitzer Prize Winner -- and Now an Epic PBS Series</B>  <P>  <I>The Prize</I> recounts the panoramic history of oil -- and the struggle for wealth power that has always surrounded oil. This struggle has shaken the world economy, dictated the outcome of wars, and transformed the destiny of men and nations. <I>The Prize</I> is as much a history of the twentieth century as of the oil industry itself. The canvas of this history is enormous -- from the drilling of the first well in Pennsylvania through two great world wars to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and Operation Desert Storm.  <P>  The cast extends from wildcatters and rogues to oil tycoons, and from Winston Churchill and Ibn Saud to George Bush and Saddam Hussein. The definitive work on the subject of oil and a major contribution to understanding our century, <I>The Prize</I> is a book of extraordinary breadth, riveting excitement -- and great importance.

    - "From the Arctic to South Africa - one finds them everywhere: Ants. Making up nearly 15% of the entire terrestrial animal biomass, ants are impressive not only in quantitative terms, they also fascinate by their highly organized and complex social system. Their caste system, the division of labor, the origin of altruistic behavior and the complex forms of chemical communication makes them the most interesting group of social organisms and the main subject for sociobiologists. Not least is their ecological importance: Ants are the premier soil turners, channelers of energy and dominatrices of the insect fauna."

    - Book
    - Dale Maharidge
    - <p>"A stunning sequel to the James AgeeWalker Evans' classic, <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i>. It is at times astonishing, at all times deeply moving."-Studs Terkel</p><p>"A book that reaches into this country's heart of darkness. . . . A tragically human story more telling than a thousand polls. The photographs by Mr. Williamson are eloquent."-Herbert Mitgang, <i>New York Times</i></p><p>"Mr. Williamson's photos are spellbinding and should become instant classics."-John Elvin, <i>Washington Times</i></p><p>In this paperback reissue, an author/photographer team returns to the land and families captured in James Agee and Walker Evans's inimitable masterwork <i>Let Us Now Praise Famous Men</i>, extending the project of conscience and chronicling the traumatic decline of King Cotton. In 1936, during a brief window of national attention to the topic, <i>Fortune</i> magazine commissioned from Agee and Evans a story on poverty among tenant farmers in Alabama. Agee was famously ambivalent in his role, calling himself a spy and ultimately delivering a book-length manuscript unpublishable in magazine form. With this continuation of Agee and Evans's work, Maharidge and Williamson not only uncover some surprising historical secrets relating to the families and to Agee himself, but also effectively lay to rest Agee's fear that his work, from lack of reverence or resilience, would be but another offense to the humanity of its subjects.</p><p>Williamson's 90-part photo essay includes updates alongside Evans' classic originals.</p><p><b>Dale Maharidge</b> (<i>Homeland, Journey to Nowhere</i>) has been a visiting professor of journalism at Columbia University and Stanford, and a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 1998.</p><p><b>Michael Williamson</b> is a photographer for the <i>Washington Post</i> who won a second Pulitzer for his coverage of the war in Kosovo.</p>

Witnessing the arrogance and self-deception firsthand, Vann put his life and career on the line in an attempt to convince his superiors that the war should be fought another way. But by the time he died in 1972, Vann had embraced the follies he once decried.

    - The Making of the Atomic Bomb
    - Book
    - Richard Rhodes
    - <P>  Here for the first time, in rich, human, political, and scientific detail, is the complete story of how the bomb was developed, from the turn-of-the-century discovery of the vast energy locked inside the atom to the dropping of the first bombs on Japan.  <P>  Few great discoveries have evolved so swiftly -- or have been so misunderstood. From the theoretical discussions of nuclear energy to the bright glare of Trinity there was a span of hardly more than twenty-five years. What began as merely an interesting speculative problem in physics grew into the Manhattan Project, and then into the Bomb with frightening rapidity, while scientists known only to their peers -- Szilard, Teller, Oppenheimer, Bohr, Meitner, Fermi, Lawrence, and yon Neumann -- stepped from their ivory towers into the limelight.  <P>  Richard Rhodes takes us on that journey step by step, minute by minute, and gives us the definitive story of man's most awesome discovery and invention. <I>The Making of the Atomic Bomb</I> has been compared in its sweep and importance to William L. Shirer's <I>The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich.</I> It is at once a narrative tour de force and a document as powerful as its subject.

Susan Sheehan, a talented reporter followed \"Sylvia\" for almost a year talking with and observing her listening to her monologues, sitting in on consultations with doctors, even for a period sleeping in the bed next to her in a mental hospital.<P>\"Susan Sheehan has committed an extraordinary act of journalism....She brings relentless intelligent attention to bear on a particular case, a journalistic practice that almost always results in new and disturbing insights into those mindless generalities and prejudice and certitudes we tend to carry around with us.\" -- Meg Greenfield, front page Washington Post Book World<P>\"Sheehan is tenacious, observant and unsentimental. The history of a single patient leads us into a maze of understaffed institutions, bureaucratic fumbling, trial-and-error treatment and familial incomprehension.

    - Book
    - Tracy Kidder
    - Computers have changed since 1981, when Tracy Kidder memorably recorded the drama, comedy, and excitement of one companys efforts to bring a new microcomputer to market. What has not changed is the feverish pace of the high-tech industry, the go-for-broke approach to business that has caused so many computer companies to win big (or go belly up), and the cult of pursuing mind-bending technological innovations. The Soul of a New Machine is an essential chapter in the history of the machine that revolutionized the world in the twentieth century.

    - <P> Winner of the Pulitzer prize in 1974 and the culmination of a life's work, <I>The Denial of Death</I> is Ernest Becker's brilliant and impassioned answer to the "why" of human existence. In bold contrast to the predominant Freudian school of thought, Becker tackles the problem of the vital lie -- man's refusal to acknowledge his own mortality. In doing so, he sheds new light on the nature of humanity and issues a call to life and its living that still resonates more than twenty years after its writing.

With a clarity and authority unrivaled by any book before it or since, Fire in the Lake shows how America utterly and tragically misinterpreted the realities of Vietnam.

    - "In the 1950s Robert Coles began studying, living among, and, above all, listening to American children. The results of his efforts--revealed in five volumes published between 1967 and 1977--constitute one of the most searching and vigorous social studies ever undertaken by one person in the United States. Here, heard often in their own voices, are America's \"children of crisis\": African American children caught in the throes of the South's racial integration; The children of impoverished migrant workers in Appalachia; Children whose families were transformed by the migration from South to North, from rural to urban communities; Latino, Native American, and Eskimo children in the poorest communities of the American West; The children of America's wealthiest families confronting the burden of their own privilege. This volume restores to print a masterwork of psychological and sociological inquiry--a book that, in its focus on how children learn and develop in the face of rapid change and social upheaval, speaks directly and pointedly to our own times.

    - "Barbara W. Tuchman won the Pulitzer Prize for Stilwell and the American Experience in China, 1911-45 in 1972. She uses the life of Joseph Stilwell, the military attache to China in 1935-39 and commander of United States forces and allied chief of staff to Chiang Kai-shek in 1942-44, to explore the history of China from the revolution of 1911 to the turmoil of World War II, when China's Nationalist government faced attack from Japanese invaders and Communist insurgents. Her story is an account of both American relations with China and the experiences of one of our men on the ground. In the cantankerous but level-headed \"Vinegar Joe,\" Tuchman found a subject who allowed her to perform, in the words of The National Review, \"one of the historian's most envied magic acts: conjoining a fine biography of a man with a fascinating epic story.\""

    - David Halberstam
    - <P> "One of the best books I've ever read about American sports!"  <br>--Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, <i>The New York Times</i></P>    <P>Available for the first time in years, David Halberstam's <i>The Breaks of the Game</i> focuses on one grim season (1979-80) in the life of the Portland Trail Blazers, a team that only three years before had been National Basketball Association champions. </p><P><P>As Halberstam follows this collection of men through the months, through the losing streaks and occasional victories, the endless trips and the brutal schedules, we come to know them and their world--the other players, coaches, and owners; the competition, drafts, trades, and traditions; the wives, the fans, the media connections--a world of grand dreams, impossible expectations, and bracing realities.  </p><P><P>The tactile authenticity of Halberstam's knowledge of the basketball world is unrivaled.  Yet he is writing here about far more than just basketball. This is a story about a place in our society where power, money, and talent collide and sometimes corrupt, a place where both national obsessions and naked greed are exposed. It's about the influence of big media, the fans and the hype they subsist on, the clash of ethics, the terrible physical demands of modern sports (from drugs to body size), the unreal salaries, the conflicts of race and class, and the consequences of sport converted into mass entertainment and athletes transformed into superstars--all presented in a way that puts the reader in the room and on the court, and <i>The Breaks of the Game</i> in a league of its own.</p>

Mauboussin's popular guide to wise investing has been translated into eight languages and has been named best business book by  <I>BusinessWeek</I> and best economics book by  <I>Strategy+Business</I>. Now updated to reflect current research and expanded to include new chapters on investment philosophy, psychology, and strategy and science as they pertain to money management, this volume is more than ever the best chance to know more than the average investor.</P><P>Offering invaluable tools to better understand the concepts of choice and risk,  <I>More Than You Know</I> is a unique blend of practical advice and sound theory, sampling from a wide variety of sources and disciplines. Mauboussin builds on the ideas of visionaries, including Warren Buffett and E. O. Wilson, but also finds wisdom in a broad and deep range of fields, such as casino gambling, horse racing, psychology, and evolutionary biology. He analyzes the strategies of poker experts David Sklansky and Puggy Pearson and pinpoints parallels between mate selection in guppies and stock market booms. For this edition, Mauboussin includes fresh thoughts on human cognition, management assessment, game theory, the role of intuition, and the mechanisms driving the market's mood swings, and explains what these topics tell us about smart investing.</P><P> <I>More Than You Know</I> is written with the professional investor in mind but extends far beyond the world of economics and finance. Mauboussin groups his essays into four parts-Investment Philosophy, Psychology of Investing, Innovation and Competitive Strategy, and Science and Complexity Theory-and he includes substantial references for further reading. A true eye-opener,  <I>More Than You Know</I> shows how a multidisciplinary approach that pays close attention to process and the psychology of decision making offers the best chance for long-term financial results.</P>

Perhaps they married too young and started a family too early. Maybe Frank's job <i>is </i>dull. And April never saw herself as a housewife. Yet they have always lived on the assumption that greatness is only just around the corner. But now that certainty is about to crumble.<br><br>With heartbreaking compassion and remorseless clarity, Richard Yates shows how Frank and April mortgage their spiritual birthright, betraying not only each other, but their best selves."

    - Book
    - Geoff Dyer
    - "A wildly original novel of erotic fulfillment and spiritual yearning. <br><br>Every two years the international art world descends on Venice for the opening of the Biennale. Among them is Jeff Atman\xE2\x80\x93a jaded and dissolute journalist\xE2\x80\x93whose dedication to the cause of Bellini-fuelled partygoing is only intermittently disturbed by the obligation to file a story. When he meets the spellbinding Laura, he is rejuvenated, ecstatic. Their romance blossoms quickly, but is it destined to disappear just as rapidly? <br><br>Every day thousands of pilgrims head to the banks of the Ganges at Varanasi, the holiest Hindu city in India. Among their number is a narrator who may or may not be the Atman previously seen in Venice. Intending to visit only for a few days he ends up staying for months, and suddenly finds\xE2\x80\x93or should that be loses?\xE2\x80\x93a hitherto unexamined idea of himself, <i>the </i>self. In a romance he can only observe, he sees a reflection of the kind of pleasures that, willingly or not, he has renounced.  In the process, two ancient and watery cities become versions of each other. Could two stories, in two different cities, actually be one and the same story? <br><br>Nothing Geoff Dyer has written before is as wonderfully unbridled, as dead-on in evocation of place, longing and the possibility of neurotic enlightenment, and as irrepressibly entertaining as <i>Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi.</i><br><i><br></i><br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

    - "The Weight of a Mustard Seed: The Intimate Story of an Iraqi General and His Family During Thirty Years of Tyranny"
    - Book
    - Wendell Steavenson
    - "<p> General Kamel Sachet was a favorite of Saddam Hussein's, a hero of the Iran-Iraq war, head of the army in Kuwait City during Desert Storm, governor of the province of Maysan, and father of nine children. When author Wendell Steavenson became intrigued by his story, she began with a few questions about Sachet and his fellow Baathist loyalists: \"Why had they served such a regime? How had they accommodated their own morality? How had they lived? How had they lived with themselves?\" Her journey to find these answers took five years, and an accumulation of facts, opinions, fears, confessions and suspicions from Sachet's family, friends, and enemies. The result is not just a gripping account of one man's rise and fall, but a vivid and compassionate portrayal of the Iraqi people. </p> <p> As Sachet rose from policeman to Special Forces officer and then General, he made more and more sacrifices to remain in Saddam's good favor. Steadfast in his loyalty to God and his President, Sachet attended military executions and endured his own imprisonment as Saddam's behavior took increasingly paranoiac and power-crazy turns. But when it came time for Sachet's sons to do their military service, he refused to let them join the \"criminal\" organization to which he had given his life. Kamel Sachet realized, too late, that he'd become a participant in the terror regime that had strangled his county and destroyed its people. Through his story and the stories of those around him, Wendell Steavenson shows the choices Iraqis have had to make between exile and collaboration, God and jihad. Here are the Iraqis behind the headlines and the tragedy begotten of unintended consequences. And here is the first full-length narrative from an immensely talented journalist who has already been compared by critics to Bruce Chatwin and Ryszard Kapucinksi. </p>"

    - Shadow Country (Modern Library Paperbacks)
    - Book
    - Peter Matthiessen
    - "<b>2008 NATIONAL BOOK AWARD WINNER</b><br><br>Peter Matthiessen\xE2\x80\x99s great American epic\xE2\x80\x93Killing Mister Watson, Lost Man\xE2\x80\x99s River, and Bone by Bone\xE2\x80\x93was conceived as one vast mysterious novel, but because of its length it was originally broken up into three books. In this bold new rendering, Matthiessen has cut nearly a third of the overall text and collapsed the time frame while deepening the insights and motivations of his characters with brilliant rewriting throughout. In <i>Shadow Country,</i> he has marvelously distilled a monumental work, realizing his original vision. <br><br>Inspired by a near-mythic event of the wild Florida frontier at the turn of the twentieth century, Shadow Country reimagines the legend of the inspired Everglades sugar planter and notorious outlaw E. J. Watson, who drives himself relentlessly toward his own violent end at the hands of neighbors who mostly admired him, in a killing that obsessed his favorite son.<br><i><br>Shadow Country</i> traverses strange landscapes and frontier hinterlands inhabited by Americans of every provenance and color, including the black and Indian inheritors of the archaic racism that, as Watson\xE2\x80\x99s wife observed, \"still casts its shadow over the nation.\"<br><br>Peter Matthiessen\xE2\x80\x99s lyrical and illuminating work in the Watson narrative has been praised highly by such contemporaries as Saul Bellow, William Styron, and W. S. Merwin. Joseph Heller said \"I read it in great gulps, up each night later than I wanted to be, in my hungry impatience to find out more and more.\" <br><br><u>Praise for<i> Shadow Country</i></u><br>\xE2\x80\x9C<i>Shadow Country</i> is altogether gripping, shocking, and <b>brilliantly told</b>, not just a tour de force in its stylistic range, but<b> a great American novel, as powerful a reading experience as nearly any in our literature.</b> This magnificent, sad masterpiece about race, history, and defeated dreams can easily stand comparison with Ralph Ellison's <i>Invisible Man</i> and Robert Penn Warren's All <i>the King's Men</i>. Little wonder, too, that parts of the story of E.J. Watson call up comparisons with Dostoevsky, Conrad, and, inevitably, Faulkner<b>. In every way, <i>Shadow Country</i> is a bravura performance, at once history, fiction, and myth\xE2\x80\x93as well as the capstone to the career of one of the most admired and admirable writers of our time</b>.\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x94 <i>The New York Review of Books</i><br><br>\xE2\x80\x9CMagnificent and capacious\xE2\x80\xA6. I'll just say right here that the book took my sleeve and like the ancient mariner would not let go. <b>Matthiessen has made his three-part saga into a new thing\xE2\x80\xA6. Finally now we have these books welded like a bell, and with Watson's song the last sound, all the elements fuse and resonate\xE2\x80\xA6.a breathtaking saga.\xE2\x80\x9D</b> \xE2\x80\x94 <i>The Los Angeles Times<br></i><br>\xE2\x80\x9C<b>Gorgeously written and unfailingly compelling,</b> <b><i>Shadow Country</i> is the exhilarating masterwork of [Matthiessen\xE2\x80\x99s] career, every bit as ambitious as <i>Moby Dick</i></b>.\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x94 <i>National Geographic Adventure</i> magazine<br><br>\xE2\x80\x9CPeter Mattiessen consolidates his <b>epic masterpiece</b> of Florida -- and crafts something even better\xE2\x80\xA6[He] deserves credit for decades of meticulous research and obsessive details and soaring prose that converted the Watson legend into critically acclaimed literature\xE2\x80\xA6.Anyone wanting an explanation for what happened to Florida can now find it in a single novel, <b>a great American novel</b>.\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x94 <i>Miami Herald<br></i><br>\xE2\x80\x9CMatthiessen is writing about one man's life in <i>Shadow Country</i>, but he is also writing about the life of the nation over the course of half a century. Watson's story is essentially the story of the American frontier, of the conquering of wild lands and people, and of what such empires cost\xE2\x80\xA6.<b>Even among a body of work as magnificent as Matthiessen's, this is his great book.</b>\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x94 <i>St. Petersburg Times<br></i><br>\xE2\x80\x9C<b><i>Shadow Country</i> is a magnum opus</b>.

It is a testament to Mr. Matthiessen\xE2\x80\x99s integrity as an artist that he felt compelled to return to the Watson material to produce this work and satisfy his original vision\xE2\x80\xA6.a multifaceted work that can be read variously or simultaneously as a psychological novel, a historical novel, a morality tale, a political allegory, or a mystery. -- <i>East Hampton Star<br><br></i>\xE2\x80\x9CMatthiessen\xE2\x80\x99s Watson trilogy is<b> a touchstone of modern American literature</b>\xE2\x80\xA6this reworking\xE2\x80\xA6is<b> remarkable\xE2\x80\xA6.Where Watson was a magnificent character before, he comes across as nothing short of iconic here; it\xE2\x80\x99s difficult to find another figure in American literature so thoroughly and confincingly portrayed.</b>\xE2\x80\x9D \xE2\x80\x94 <i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review, Pick of the Week<br>\xE2\x80\x9CMatthiessen has reinvigorated and rejoined the trilogy\xE2\x80\x99s novels\xE2\x80\xA6a mosaic about the life and lynch-mob death of a turn-of-the century Florida Everglades sugar planter and serial killer named E.

No doubt about it. <b>SHADOW COUNTRY lives up to anyone's highest expectations for great writing</b>.\" --  Richard Ford <br>\"Peter Matthiessen is a brilliantly gifted and ambitious writer, an inspired anatomist of the American mythos.  His storytelling skills are prodigious and his rapport with his subject is remarkable.\"  -- Joyce Carol Oates<br>\"Peter Matthiessen's work, both in fiction and non-fiction, has become a unique achievement in his own generation and in American literature as a whole. Everything that he has written has been conveyed in his own clear, deeply informed, elegant and powerful prose.  The Watson saga-in-the-round, to which he has devoted nearly thirty years, is <b>his crowning achievement</b>.  <b>SHADOW COUNTRY, </b>his distillation of the earlier trilogy, is his transmutation of it to represent his original vision.  It<b> is the quintessence of his lifelong concerns, and a great legacy</b>.\"  -- W.S. Merwin<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

As she did in her enormously popular novel <i>The Volcano Lover</i>, Susan Sontag casts a story located in the past in a fresh, provocative light to create a fictional world full of contemporary resonance.  <br><br>In 1876 a group of Poles led by Maryna Zalezowska, Poland's greatest actress, emigrate to the United States and travel to California to found a \"utopian commune.\" When the commune fails, Maryna stays, learns English, and\xE2\x80\x94as Marina Zalenska\xE2\x80\x94forges a new, even more triumphant career on the American stage, becoming a diva on par with Sara Bernhardt.  <br><br><i>In America </i>is about many things: a woman's search for self-transformation; the fate of idealism; a life in the theater; the many varieties of love; and, not least of all, stories and storytelling itself. Operatic in the scope and intensity of the emotions it depicts, richly detailed and visionary in its account of America, and peopled with unforgettable characters.<br>"

Sorely wounded and fatally disillusioned in the fighting at Petersburg, a Confederate soldier named Inman decides to walk back to his home in the Blue Ridge mountains to Ada, the woman he loves. His trek across the disintegrating South brings him into intimate and sometimes lethal converse with slaves and marauders, bounty hunters and witches, both helpful and malign. At the same time, the intrepid Ada is trying to revive her father\xE2\x80\x99s derelict farm and learning to survive in a world where the old certainties have been swept away. As it interweaves their stories, <i>Cold Mountain</i> asserts itself as an authentic odyssey, hugely powerful, majestically lovely, and keenly moving."

    - Book
    - Andrea Barrett
    - "<B>1996 National Book Award Winner for Fiction.</B> The elegant short fictions gathered hereabout the love of science and the science of love are often set against the backdrop of the nineteenth century. Interweaving historical and fictional characters, they encompass both past and present as they negotiate the complex territory of ambition, failure, achievement, and shattered dreams. In \"Ship Fever,\" the title novella, a young Canadian doctor finds himself at the center of one of history's most tragic epidemics. In \"The English Pupil,\" Linnaeus, in old age, watches as the world he organized within his head slowly drifts beyond his reach. And in \"The Littoral Zone,\" two marine biologists wonder whether their life-altering affair finally was worth it. In the tradition of Alice Munro and William Trevor, these exquisitely rendered fictions encompass whole lives in a brief space. As they move between interior and exterior journeys, \"science is transformed from hard and known fact into malleable, strange and thrilling fictional material\" (Boston Globe). "

Winner of the 1979 National Book Award, <b>Going After Cacciato</b> captures the peculiar mixture of horror and hallucination that marked this strangest of wars.<br><br>In a blend of reality and fantasy, this novel tells the story of a young soldier who one day lays down his rifle and sets off on a quixotic journey from the jungles of Indochina to the streets of Paris. In its memorable evocation of men both fleeing from and meeting the demands of battle, <b>Going After Cacciato</b> stands as much more than just a great war novel. Ultimately it's about the forces of fear and heroism that do battle in the hearts of us all."

    - In Saigon during the waning days of the Vietnam War, a small-time journalist named John Converse thinks he'll find action - and profit - by getting involved in a big-time drug deal. But back in the States, things go horribly wrong for him. Dog Soldiers perfectly captures the underground mood of America in the 1970s, when amateur drug dealers and hippies encountered profiteering cops and professional killers - and the price of survival was dangerously high.

A winner of the National Book Award, this feisty, witty, sometimes bawdy book provoked Playboy to comment, "There"s every chance in the world that John Barth is a genius."

There are thirty-one stories here in all, including twelve that do not appear in the only two story collections O'Connor put together in her short lifetime--<i>Everything That Rises Must Converge </i>and <i>A Good Man Is Hard to Find</i>. <br><br>O'Connor published her first story, \"The Geranium,\" in 1946, while she was working on her master's degree at the University of Iowa. Arranged chronologically, this collection shows that her last story, \"Judgement Day\"--sent to her publisher shortly before her death\xE2\x80\x94is a brilliantly rewritten and transfigured version of \"The Geranium.\" Taken together, these stories reveal a lively, penetrating talent that has given us some of the most powerful and disturbing fiction of the twentieth century. Also included is an introduction by O'Connor's longtime editor and friend, Robert Giroux.<br>"

When he is a much older man, fleeting memories return to him, and obeying an instinct he only dimly understands, he follows their trail back to the world he left behind a half century before. There, faced with the void at the heart of twentieth-century Europe, he struggles to rescue his heritage from oblivion."

    - Jim Crace
    - "Lying in the sand dunes of Baritone Bay are the bodies of a middle-aged couple. Celice and Joseph, in their mid-50s and married for more than 30 years, are returning to the seacoast where they met as students. Instead, they are battered to death by a thief with a chunk of granite. Their corpses lie undiscovered and rotting for a week, prey to sand crabs, flies, and gulls. Yet there remains something touching about the scene, with Joseph's hand curving lightly around his wife's leg, \"quietly resting; flesh on flesh; dead, but not departed yet.\" <br><br><i>\"Their bodies had expired, but anyone could tell\xE2\x80\x94just look at them\xE2\x80\x94that Joseph and Celice were still devoted. For while his hand was touching her, curved round her shin, the couple seemed to have achieved that peace the world denies, a period of grace, defying even murder. Anyone who found them there, so wickedly disfigured, would nevertheless be bound to see that something of their love had survived the death of cells. The corpses were surrendered to the weather and the earth, but they were still a man and wife, quietly resting; flesh on flesh; dead, but not departed yet.\"</i><br><br>From that moment forward, <i>Being Dead</i> becomes less about murder and more about death. Alternating chapters move back in time from the murder in hourly and two-hourly increments. As the narrative moves backward, we see Celice and Joseph make the small decisions about their day that will lead them inexorably towards their own deaths. In other chapters the narrative moves forward. Celice and Joseph are on vacation and nobody misses them until they do not return. Thus, it is six days before their bodies are found. Crace describes in minute detail their gradual return to the land with the help of crabs, birds, and the numerous insects that attack the body and gently and not so gently prepare it for the dust-to-dust phase of death.<br>"

    - Motherless Brooklyn
    - Book
    - Jonathan Lethem
    - From America's most inventive novelist, Jonathan Lethem, comes this compelling and compulsive riff on the classic detective novel.<br><br>Lionel Essrog is Brooklyn's very own self-appointed Human Freakshow, an orphan whose Tourettic impulses drive him to bark, count, and rip apart our language in startling and original ways.  Together with three veterans of the St. Vincent's Home for Boys, he works for small-time mobster Frank Minna's limo service cum detective agency. Life without Frank Minna, the charismatic King of Brooklyn, would be unimaginable, so who cares if the tasks he sets them are, well, not exactly legal. But when Frank is fatally stabbed, one of Lionel's colleagues lands in jail, the other two vie for his position, and the victim's widow skips town. Lionel's world is suddenly topsy-turvy, and this outcast who has trouble even conversing attempts to untangle the threads of the case while trying to keep the words straight in his head.  <b>Motherless Brooklyn</b> is a brilliantly original homage to the classic detective novel by one of the most acclaimed writers of his generation.<br>

    - "The Love of a Good Woman : Stories"
    - Book
    - Alice Munro
    - "In eight new stories, a master of the form extends and magnifies her great themes--the vagaries of love, the passion that leads down unexpected paths, the chaos hovering just under the surface of things, and the strange, often comical desires of the human heart.<br><br>Time stretches out in some of the stories: a man and a woman look back forty years to the summer they met--the summer, as it turns out, that the true nature of their lives was revealed. In others time is telescoped: a young girl finds in the course of an evening that the mother she adores, and whose fluttery sexuality she hopes to emulate, will not sustain her--she must count on herself.<br><br>Some choices are made--in a will, in a decision to leave home--with irrevocable and surprising consequences. At other times disaster is courted or barely skirted: when a mother has a startling dream about her baby; when a woman, driving her grandchildren to visit the lakeside haunts of her youth, starts a game that could have dangerous consequences. The rich layering that gives Alice Munro's work so strong a sense of life is particularly apparent in the title story, in which the death of a local optometrist brings an entire town into focus--from the preadolescent boys who find his body, to the man who probably killed him, to the woman who must decide what to do about what she might know. Large, moving, profound--these are stories that extend the limits of fiction."

    - Billy Bathgate
    - Book
    - E. L. Doctorow
    - "In 1930's New York, Billy Bathgate, a fifteen-year-old high-school dropout, has captured the attention of infamous gangster Dutch Schultz, who lures the boy into his world of racketeering. The product of an East Bronx upbringing by his half-crazy Irish Catholic mother, after his Jewish father left them long ago, Billy is captivated by the world of money, sex, and high society the charismatic Schultz has to offer. But it is also a world of extortion, brutality, and murder, where Billy finds himself involved in a dangerous affair with Schultz's girlfriend.  Relive this story through the title character's driving narrative, a child's thoughts and feelings filtered through the sensibilities of an adult, and the result is E.L. Doctorow's most convincing and appealing portrayal of a young boy's life. Converging mythology and history, one of America's most admired authors has captured the romance of gangsters and criminal enterprise that continues to fascinate the American psyche today. "

    - The Middleman and Other Stories
    - Book
    - Bharati Mukherjee
    - Bharati Mukherjee's work illuminates a new world of people in migration that has transformed the meaning of "America." Now in a Grove paperback edition, The Middleman and Other Stories is a dazzling display of the vision of this important modern writer. An aristocratic Filipina negotiates a new life for herself with an Atlanta investment banker. A Vietnam vet returns to Florida, a place now more foreign than the Asia of his war experience. And in the title story, an Iraqi Jew whose travels have ended in Queens suddenly finds himself an unwitting guerrilla in a South American jungle. Passionate, comic, violent, and tender, these stories draw us into the center of a cultural fusion in the midst of its birth pangs, yet glowing with the energy and exuberance of a society remaking itself.

    - The Counterlife
    - Book
    - Philip Roth
    - <b>The Counterlife</b> is about people enacting their dreams of renewal and escape, some of them going so far as to risk their lives to alter seemingly irreversible destinies. Wherever they may find themselves, the characters of <b>The Counterlife</b> are tempted unceasingly by the prospect of an alternative existence that can reverse their fate.<br><br>Illuminating these lives in transition and guiding us through the book's evocative landscapes, familiar and foreign, is the miind of the novelist Nathan Zuckerman. His is the skeptical, enveloping intelligence that calculates the price that's paid in the struggle to change personal fortune and reshape history, whether in a dentist's office in suburban New Jersey, or in a tradition-bound English Village in Gloucestershire, or in a church in London's West End, or in a tiny desert settlement in Israel's occupied West Bank.

    - The Transit of Venus
    - Book
    - Shirley Hazzard
    - "<i>The Transit of Venus</i> is considered Shirley Hazzard's most brilliant novel. It tells the story of two orphan sisters, Caroline and Grace Bell, as they leave Australia to start a new life in post-war England. What happens to these young women--seduction and abandonment, marriage and widowhood, love and betrayal--becomes as moving and wonderful and yet as predestined as the transits of the planets themselves. Gorgeously written and intricately constructed, Hazzard's novel is a story of place: Sydney, London, New York, Stockholm; of time: from the fifties to the eighties; and above all, of women and men in their passage through the displacements and absurdities of modern life. <br><br>\"Engrossing, masterly. . . . Combines the satisfaction of a family saga . . . with a highly structured plot reminiscent of Greek tragedy.\"-- Gail Godwin, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>\"A wonderfully mysterious book. . . . Both plot and characters are many layered. Unforgettably rich.\"-- Anne Tyler, <i>The New Republic</i><br><br>\"Luminous. . . . Almost without flaw. Aphoristic and iridescent, her language turns paragraphs into events.\"-- Webster Schott, <i>The Washington Post Book World</i>"

    - The Year of the French
    - Book
    - Thomas Flanagan
    - In 1798, Irish patriots, committed to freeing their country from England, landed with a company of French troops in County Mayo, in westernmost Ireland. They were supposed to be an advance guard, followed by other French ships with the leader of the rebellion, Wolfe Tone. Briefly they triumphed, raising hopes among the impoverished local peasantry and gathering a group of supporters. But before long the insurgency collapsed before a brutal English counterattack.    <P>Very few books succeed in registering the sudden terrible impact of historical events; Thomas Flanagan's is one. Subtly conceived, masterfully paced, with a wide and memorable cast of characters, <I>The Year of the French</I> brings to life peasants and landlords, Protestants and Catholics, along with old and abiding questions of secular and religious commitments, empire, occupation, and rebellion. It is quite simply a great historical novel.

    - October Light
    - Book
    - John Gardner
    - <B> Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award. New Directions is excited to reissue the Gardner classics, beginning with <I>October Light</I>, a complex relationship rendered in a down-to-earth narrative.</B><BR><BR><I>October Light</I> is one of John Gardner's masterworks. The penniless widow of a once-wealthy dentist, Sally Abbot now lives in the Vermont farmhouse of her older brother, 72-year-old James Page. Polar opposites in nearly every way, their clash of values turns a bitter corner when the exacting and resolute James takes a shotgun to his sister's color television set. After he locks Sally up in her room with the trashy "blockbuster" novel that has consumed her (and only apples to eat), the novel-within-the-novel becomes an echo chamber providing glimpses into the history of the family that spawned these bizarre, sad, and stubborn people. Gardner uses the turbulent siblings as a stepping-off point from which he expands upon the lives of their extended families, and the rural community that surrounds them. He also engages larger issues of how liberals and conservatives define themselves, and considers those moments when life transcends all their arguments.

As the two men share their vastly different experiences of contemporary immigrant life in America, an unforgettable portrait emerges of an "other" New York populated by immigrants and strivers of every race and nationality.

    - Philip Roth
    - Philip Roth's new novel is a candidly intimate yet universal story of loss, regret, and stoicism. The bestselling author of <i>The Plot Against America</i> now turns his attention from "one family's harrowing encounter with history" (<i>New York Times</i>) to one man's lifelong skirmish with mortality.<br><br>The fate of Roth's everyman is traced from his first shocking confrontation with death on the idyllic beaches of his childhood summers, through the family trials and professional achievements of his vigorous adulthood, and into his old age, when he is rended by observing the deterioration of his contemporaries and stalked by his own physical woes.<br><br>The terrain of this powerful novel is the human body. Its subject is the common experience that terrifies us all.

    - "Winner of the PEN/Faulkner award for fiction in 2003, <i>The Caprices</i> is a collection of stories artfully told across the theatre of the Pacific Campaign of World War II. An Anglo-Indian cavalryman, his homeland on the brink of revolution, finds himself in Malaysia fighting to protect British interests. Two soldiers lost in the jungle with a Japanese prisoner confront their prejudices toward each other, and the nature of being American. An island witnesses the passing of history from Magellan, to Amelia Earhart, to the dropping of the atomic bomb. With exquisite lyricism tempered by a journalist\xE2\x80\x99s eye for detail, Murray shines light on the tangle of battles created by that conflict, the violent reach across the generations, the shattering reverberations in memory. With this collection, Sabina Murray established herself as a passionate and wise voice of literary fiction."

The charge is a lie, but the real truth about Silk would have astonished even his most virulent accuser.<br><br>Coleman Silk has a secret, one which has been kept for fifty years from his wife, his four children, his colleagues, and his friends, including the writer Nathan Zuckerman.  It is Zuckerman who stumbles upon Silk's secret and sets out to reconstruct the unknown biography of this eminent, upright man, esteemed as an educator for nearly all his life, and to understand how this ingeniously contrived life came unraveled.  And to understand also how Silk's astonishing private history is, in the words of <i>The</i> <i>Wall Street Journal</i>,  "magnificently" interwoven with "the larger public history of modern America."<br>

    - <P>  E. Annie Proulx's first novel, <I>Postcards,</I> winner of the 1993 Pen/Faulkner Award for Fiction, tells the mesmerizing tale of Loyal Blood, who misspends a lifetime running from a crime so terrible that it renders him forever incapable of touching a woman.  <P>  Blood's odyssey begins in 1944 and takes him across the country from his hardscrabble Vermont hill farm to New York, across Ohio, Minnesota, and Montana to British Columbia, on to North Dakota, Wyoming, and New Mexico and ends, today, in California, with Blood homeless and near mad. Along the way, he must live a hundred lives to survive, mining gold, growing beans, hunting fossils and trapping, prospecting for uranium, and ranching. In his absence, disaster befalls his family; greatest among their terrible losses are the hard-won values of endurance and pride that were the legacy of farm people rooted in generations of intimacy with soil, weather, plants, and seasons.  <P>  <I>Postcards</I> chronicles the lives of the rural and the dispossessed and charts their territory with the historical verisimilitude and writerly prowess of Cather, Dreiser, and Faulkner. It is a new American classic.

    - Book
    - Michael Chabon
    - "<p> For sixty years Jewish refugees and their descendants have prospered in the Federal District of Sitka, a \"temporary\" safe haven created in the wake of the Holocaust and the shocking 1948 collapse of the fledgling state of Israel. The Jews of the Sitka District have created their own little world in the Alaskan panhandle, a vibrant and complex frontier city that moves to the music of Yiddish. But now the District is set to revert to Alaskan control, and their dream is coming to an end. </p> <p> Homicide detective Meyer Landsman of the District Police has enough problems without worrying about the upcoming Reversion. His life is a shambles, his marriage a wreck, his career a disaster. And in the cheap hotel where Landsman has washed up, someone has just committed a murder\xE2\x80\x94right under his nose. When he begins to investigate the killing of his neighbor, a former chess prodigy, word comes down from on high that the case is to be dropped immediately, and Landsman finds himself contending with all the powerful forces of faith, obsession, evil, and salvation that are his heritage. </p> <p> At once a gripping whodunit, a love story, and an exploration of the mysteries of exile and redemption, <i>The Yiddish Policemen's Union</i> is a novel only Michael Chabon could have written. </p>"

    - "Four time Hugo Award winner Vernor Vinge has taken readers to the depths of space and into the far future in his bestselling novels <I>A Fire Upon the Deep</I> and <I>A Deepness in the Sky</I>. Now, he has written a science-fiction thriller set in a place and time as exciting and strange as any far-future world: San Diego, California, 2025.<BR>\xC2\xA0<BR>Robert Gu is a recovering Alzheimer's patient. The world that he remembers was much as we know it today. Now, as he regains his faculties through a cure developed during the years of his near-fatal decline, he discovers that the world has changed and so has his place in it. He was a world-renowned poet. Now he is seventy-five years old, though by a medical miracle he looks much younger, and he\xE2\x80\x99s starting over, for the first time unsure of his poetic gifts. Living with his son\xE2\x80\x99s family, he has no choice but to learn how to cope with a new information age in which the virtual and the real are a seamless continuum, layers of reality built on digital views seen by a single person or millions, depending on your choice. But the consensus reality of the digital world is available only if, like his thirteen-year-old granddaughter Miri, you know how to wear your wireless access\xE2\x80\x94through nodes designed into <I>smart</I> clothes\xE2\x80\x94and to see the digital context\xE2\x80\x94through <I>smart</I> contact lenses. <BR>\xC2\xA0<BR>With knowledge comes risk. When Robert begins to re-train at Fairmont High, learning with other older people what is second nature to Miri and other teens at school, he unwittingly becomes part of a wide-ranging conspiracy to use technology as a tool for world domination. <BR>\xC2\xA0<BR>In a world where every computer chip has Homeland Security built-in, this conspiracy is something that baffles even the most sophisticated security analysts, including Robert\xE2\x80\x99s son and daughter-in law, two top people in the U.S. military. And even Miri, in her attempts to protect her grandfather, may be entangled in the plot. <BR>\xC2\xA0<BR>As Robert becomes more deeply involved in conspiracy, he is shocked to learn of a radical change planned for the UCSD Geisel Library; all the books there, and worldwide, would cease to physically exist. He and his fellow re-trainees feel compelled to join protests against the change. With forces around the world converging on San Diego, both the conspiracy and the protest climax in a spectacular moment as unique and satisfying as it is unexpected. This is science fiction at its very best, by a master storyteller at his peak."

    - "One night in October when he was ten years old, Tyler Dupree stood in his back yard and watched the stars go out. They all flared into brilliance at once, then disappeared, replaced by a flat, empty black barrier. He and his best friends, Jason and Diane Lawton, had seen what became known as the Big Blackout. It would shape their lives. <BR><BR>The effect is worldwide. The sun is now a featureless disk--a heat source, rather than an astronomical object. The moon is gone, but tides remain. Not only have the world\xE2\x80\x99s artificial satellites fallen out of orbit, their recovered remains are pitted and aged, as though they\xE2\x80\x99d been in space far longer than their known lifespans. As Tyler, Jason, and Diane grow up, a space probe reveals a bizarre truth: The barrier is artificial, generated by huge alien artifacts. Time is passing faster outside the barrier than inside--more than a hundred million years per year on Earth. At this rate, the death throes of the sun are only about forty years in our future. <BR><BR>Jason, now a promising young scientist, devotes his life to working against this slow-moving apocalypse. Diane throws herself into hedonism, marrying a sinister cult leader who\xE2\x80\x99s forged a new religion out of the fears of the masses.<BR><BR>Earth sends terraforming machines to Mars to let the onrush of time do its work, turning the planet green. Next they send humans\xE2\x80\xA6and immediately get back an emissary with thousands of years of stories to tell about the settling of Mars. Then Earth\xE2\x80\x99s probes reveal that an identical barrier has appeared around Mars. Jason, desperate, seeds near space with self-replicating machines that will scatter copies of themselves outward from the sun--and report back on what they find. <BR><BR>Life on Earth is about to get much, much stranger."

    - To Say Nothing of the Dog
    - Book
    - Connie Willis
    - "In her first full-length novel since her critically acclaimed <i>Doomsday Book</i> Connie Willis, winner of multiple Hugo and Nebula Awards, once again visits the unpredictable world of time travel.  But this time the result is a joyous journey into a past and future of comic mishaps and historical cross-purposes, in which the power of human love can still make all the difference.<P>On the surface, England in the summer of 1888 is possibly the most restful time in history--lazy afternoons boating on the Thames, tea parties, croquet on the lawn--and time traveler Ned Henry is badly in need of a rest.  He's been shuttling back and forth between the 21st century and the 1940s looking for a Victorian atrocity called the bishop's birdstump.  It's only the latest in a long string of assignments from Lady Schrapnell, the rich dowager who has invaded Oxford University.  She's promised to endow the university's time-travel research project in return for their help in rebuilding the famed Coventry Cathedral, destroyed in a Nazi air raid over a hundred years before.<P>But the bargain has turned into a nightmare.  Lady Schrapnell's motto is \"God is in the details,\" and as the l25th anniversary of the cathedral's destruction--and the deadline for its proposed completion--approaches, time-travel research has fallen by the wayside.  Now Ned and his colleagues are frantically engaged in installing organ pipes, researching misericords, and generally risking life and limb.  So when Ned gets the chance to escape to the Victorian era, he jumps at it.  Unfortunately, he isn't really being sent there to recover from his time-lag symptoms, but to correct an incongruity a fellow historian, Verity Kindle, has inadvertently created by bringing something forward from the past.<P>In theory, such an act is impossible.  But now it has happened, and it's up to Ned and Verity to correct the incongruity before it alters history or, worse, destroys the space-time continuum.  And they have to do it while coping with eccentric Oxford dons, table-rapping spiritualists, a very spoiled young lady, and an even more spoiled cat.  As Ned and Verity try frantically to hold things together and find out why the incongruity happened, the breach widens, time travel goes amok, and everything starts to fall apart--until the fate of the entire space-time continuum hangs on a sance, a butler, a bulldog, the battle of Waterloo, and, above all, on the bishop's birdstump.<P>At once a mystery novel, a time-travel adventure, and a Shakespearean comedy, <i>To Say Nothing of the Dog</i> is a witty and imaginative tale of misconceptions, misunderstandings, and a chaotic world in which the shortest distance between two points is never a straight line, and the secret to the universe truly lies \"in the details.\" "

    - The red planet is red no longer, as Mars has become a perfectly inhabitable world. But while Mars flourishes, Earth is  threatened by overpopulation and    ecological disaster. Soon people look to Mars as a refuge, initiating a possible interplanetary conflict, as well as political strife between the Reds, who wish to preserve the planet in its desert state, and the Green "terraformers".  The ultimate fate of Earth, as well as the possibility of new explorations into the solar system, stand in the balance.

    - Connie Willis
    - For Kivrin, preparing an on-site study of one of the deadliest eras in humanity's  history was as simple as receiving inoculations against the diseases of the fourteenth century and inventing an alibi for a woman traveling alone.  For her instructors in the twenty-first century, it meant painstaking calculations and careful monitoring of the rendezvous location where Kivrin would be received.<br><br>But a crisis strangely linking past and future strands Kivrin in a bygone age as her fellows try desperately to rescue her.  In a time of superstition and fear, Kivrin -- barely of age herself -- finds she has become an unlikely angel of hope during one of history's darkest hours.<br><br>Five years in the writing by one of science fiction's most honored authors, Doomsday Book is a storytelling triumph.  Connie Willis draws upon her understanding of the universalities of human nature to explore the ageless issues of evil, suffering and the indomitable will of the human spirit.

Nobody knows what strange force partitioned space into these \"regions of thought,\" but when the warring Straumli realm use an ancient Transcendent artifact as a weapon, they unwittingly unleash an awesome power that destroys thousands of worlds and enslaves all natural and artificial intelligence.<br><br>Fleeing the threat, a family of scientists, including two children, are taken captive by the Tines, an alien race with a harsh medieval culture, and used as pawns in a ruthless power struggle. A rescue mission, not entirely composed of humans, must rescue the children-and a secret that may save the rest of interstellar civilization.<br>"

His psychological battles include loneliness, fear that he is becoming like the cruel brother he remembers, and fanning the flames of devotion to his beloved sister. <br><br>Is Ender the general Earth needs? But Ender is not the only result of the genetic experiments. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway for almost as long.

Sweeping, dramatic, rich with humanity, and rigorous in its science,<i> Where Later the Sweet Birds Sang</i> is widely regarded as a high point of both humanistic and "hard" SF, and won SF's  Hugo Award and Locus Award on its first publication. It is as compelling today as it was then.<br>

Miraculously provided with food, but with no clues to the meaning of their strange new afterlife, billions of people from every period of Earth's history--and prehistory--must start again.<br><br>Sir Francis Bacon would be the first to glimpse the incredible way-station, a link between worlds. This forbidden sight would spur the renowned 19th-century explorer to uncover the truth. Along with a remarkable group of compatriots, including Alice Liddell Hargreaves (the Victorian girl who was the inspiration for Alice in Wonderland), an English-speaking Neanderthal, a WWII Holocaust survivor, and a wise extraterrestrial, Burton sets sail on the magnificent river. His mission: to confront humankind's mysterious benefactors, and learn the true purpose--innocent or evil--of the Riverworld . . ."

    - The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress
    - Book
    - Robert A. Heinlein
    - Robert A. Heinlein was the most influential science fiction writer of his era, an influence so large that, as Samuel R. Delany notes, "modern critics attempting to wrestle with that influence find themselves dealing with an object rather like the sky or an ocean." He won the Hugo Award for best novel four times, a record that still stands. <i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> was the last of these Hugo-winning novels, and it is widely considered his finest work.<br><br>It is a tale of revolution, of the rebellion of the former Lunar penal colony against the Lunar Authority that controls it from Earth. It is the tale of the disparate people--a computer technician, a vigorous young female agitator, and an elderly academic--who become the rebel movement's leaders. And it is the story of Mike, the supercomputer whose sentience is known only to this inner circle, and who for reasons of his own is committed to the revolution's ultimate success.<br><br><i>The Moon is a Harsh Mistress</i> is one of the high points of modern science fiction, a novel bursting with politics, humanity, passion, innovative technical speculation, and a firm belief in the pursuit of human freedom.<br>

    - A Canticle for Leibowitz
    - Book
    - Walter M. Miller Jr.
    - <p> Winner of the 1961 Hugo Award for Best Novel and widely considered one of the most accomplished, powerful, and enduring classics of modern speculative fiction, Walter M. Miller, Jr.'s <i>A Canticle for Leibowitz</i> is a true landmark of twentieth-century literature -- a chilling and still-provocative look at a post-apocalyptic future. </p> <p> In a nightmarish ruined world slowly awakening to the light after sleeping in darkness, the infant rediscoveries of science are secretly nourished by cloistered monks dedicated to the study and preservation of the relics and writings of the blessed Saint Isaac Leibowitz. From here the story spans centuries of ignorance, violence, and barbarism, viewing through a sharp, satirical eye the relentless progression of a human race damned by its inherent humanness to recelebrate its grand foibles and repeat its grievous mistakes. Seriously funny, stunning, and tragic, eternally fresh, imaginative, and altogether remarkable, <i>A Canticle for Leibowitz</i> retains its ability to enthrall and amaze. It is now, as it always has been, a masterpiece. </p>

There is only one solution: He must accept an ancient and unforgivable heresy--and risk the futures of both worlds . . ."

    - They'd Rather Be Right
    - Book
    - Mark Clifton
    - In 1955, They'd Rather Be Right became the second novel ever to win the Hugo Award. Joe Carter, Jonathan Billings and Duane Hoskins are the most unlikely fugitives from the law imaginable. Billings is Dean of Psychosomatic Medicine at Hoxworth University, one of the nation's most prestigious institutions. Hoskins is a physicist, Doctor of Cybernetics at Hoxworth. And Joe is their lab assistant on their project to create the world's first synthetic brain. Their problem is that they succeeded. They built Bossy, the super-computer into which all facts known to science--and only facts, no unproven theories or assumptions--were programmed. Now word has gotten out that Bossy exists, and the masses are terrified. Incited by a controlling government, the public is convinced that Bossy is dangerous, even though they have no idea what Bossy is. And so the professors and Joe have been indicted and are on the run. All of this is as Joe expected. Though everyone assumes he is just an ordinary graduate student-assistant, Joe is Bossy's real creator. A telepath--the only telepath in the world, as far as he knows--Joe can project thoughts as well as receive them. By breaking down the ego-walls that would normally prevent scientific cooperation between departments, Joe orchestrated the Bossy project for his own purpose. Alone of all humanity, Joe has spent his life knowing the selfishness and closemindedness, the lusts and prejudices that every human harbors inside. With Bossy, Joe hopes to break through that barrier, for Bossy acts to remake and rejuvenate all mental and physical cells, removing prejudice and replacing it with true knowledge...Bossy promises immortality, but only to those who can open themselves to change. Hunted by federal agents, Joe and the professors hole up in the skid row basement of ex-prostitute her friend, an ex-carnival mentalist. There, they prepare Bossy for its first test, the test that will prove to the world that it can fulfill its dreams...

    - From the grand master of the American short story, these fourteen tales of domestic life in the South during the thirties and forties explore that extraordinary world of manners, expectations and unspoken understanding.  The reader is drawn as if by magnetic force into a world rendered in breathtaking, painterly detail.

    - The Barracks Thief
    - Book
    - Tobias Wolff
    - <i>The Barracks Thief</i> is the story of three young paratroopers waiting to be shipped out to Vietnam. Brought together one sweltering afternoon to stand guard over an ammunition dump threatened by a forest fire, they discover in each other an unexpected capacity for recklessness and violence. Far from being alarmed by this discovery, they are exhilarated by it; they emerge from their common danger full of confidence in their own manhood and in the bond of friendship they have formed. <P>This confidence is shaken when a series of thefts occur. The author embraces the perspectives of both the betrayer and the betrayed, forcing us to participate in lives that we might otherwise condemn, and to recognize the kinship of those lives to our own.

    - "The action of Toby Olson\xE2\x80\x99s PEN/Faulkner Award-winning novel <i>Seaview</i> sweeps eastward, following three men and two women across a wasted American continent to an apocalyptic confrontation on Cape Cod. Melinda hopes to reach the seaside where she was born before she dies of cancer.  Allen, her husband, earns their way back by golf hustling, working the links en route. Outside of Tucson, the two meet up with a Pima Indian also headed toward the Cape to help a distant relative who has claims on a golf course there that is laid out on tribal grounds.  Throughout the journey, Allen knows he is being stalked by a former friend, Richard, a drug-pusher whom he has crossed and who is now determined to murder him. The tortured lives of Richard and his wife Gerry stand as a dream of what might have become of Allen and Melinda had things been otherwise. The lines that draw these people together converge at Seaview Links, and on the mad battlefield that this golf course becomes, the novel reaches its complex ending. <i>Seaview\xE2\x80\x99s</i> vibrant language and fateful plot make this study of an America on the edge an unforgettable read."

Returning home to care for and then bury his father's closest friend and his own guardian, Old Jack Crawley, he comes upon the scant records of his family's proud and tragic history, which he drives himself to reconstruct and accept. This is the story of John's relationship with his family, the town, and the woman he loves; and also between the past and the present, between oppression and guilt, hate and violence, love and acceptance. </P>

    - "<i>In the near future, disease will be a condition of the past. Most genetic defects will be removed at birth; the remaining during infancy. Unfortunately, there will be a generation left behind. For members of that missed generation, small advances will be made. Through various programs, they will be taught to get along in the world despite their differences. They will be made active and contributing members of society. But they will never be normal.<br></i><br>Lou Arrendale is a member of that lost generation, born at the wrong time to reap the awards of medical science. Part of a small group of high-functioning autistic adults, he has a steady job with a pharmaceutical company, a car, friends, and a passion for fencing. Aside from his annual visits to his counselor, he lives a low-key, independent life. He has learned to shake hands and make eye contact. He has taught himself to use \xE2\x80\x9Cplease\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cthank you\xE2\x80\x9D and other conventions of conversation because he knows it makes others comfortable. He does his best to be as normal as possible and not to draw attention to himself. <br><br>But then his quiet life comes under attack. It starts with an experimental treatment that will reverse the effects of autism in adults. With this treatment Lou would think and act and <i>be</i> just like everyone else. But if he was suddenly free of autism, would he still be himself? Would he still love the same classical music\xE2\x80\x93with its complications and resolutions? Would he still see the same colors and patterns in the world\xE2\x80\x93shades and hues that others cannot see? Most importantly, would he still love Marjory, a woman who may never be able to reciprocate his feelings? Would it be easier for her to return the love of a \xE2\x80\x9Cnormal\xE2\x80\x9D?<br><br>There are intense pressures coming from the world around him\xE2\x80\x93including an angry supervisor who wants to cut costs by sacrificing the supports necessary to employ autistic workers. Perhaps even more disturbing are the barrage of questions within himself. For Lou must decide if he should submit to a surgery that might completely change the way he views the world . . . and the very essence of who he is.<br><br>Thoughtful, provocative, poignant, unforgettable, <i>The Speed of Dark</i> is a gripping exploration into the mind of an autistic person as he struggles with profound questions of humanity and matters of the heart.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

Then a major discovery high in the Alps --the preserved bodies of a prehistoric family--reveals a shocking link: something that has slept in our genes for millions of years is waking up. <br><br>Now, as the outbreak of this terrifying disease threatens to become a deadly epidemic, Dicken and Lang must race against time to assemble the pieces of a puzzle only they are equipped to solve--an evolutionary puzzle that will determine the future of the human race . . . if a future exists at all."

    - "In seventeenth-century France, Louis XIV rules with flamboyant ambition. In his domain, wealth and beauty take all; frivolity begets cruelty; science and  alchemy collide. From the Hall of Mirrors to the vermin-infested attics of the Chateau at Versailles, courtiers compete to please the king, sacrificing fortune, principles, and even the sacred bond between brother and sister.  <P>By the fiftieth year of his reign, Louis XIV has made France the most powerful state in the western world. Yet the Sun King's appetite for glory knows no bounds. In a bold stroke, he sends his natural philosopher on an  expedition to seek the source of immortality -- the rare, perhaps mythical, sea monsters. For the glory, of his God, his country, and his king, Father Yves de la Croix returns with his treasures: one heavy shroud packed in ice...and a covered basin that imprisons a shrieking creature."

    - "She awoke in an alley to the splash of rain. She was naked, a foot-long gash in her back was still bleeding, and her identity implant was gone. Lore Van Oesterling had been the daughter of one of the world's most powerful families...and now she was nobody, and she had to hide. <br><br>Then out of the rain walked Spanner, predator and thief, who took her in, cared for her wound, and taught her how to reinvent herself again and again. No one could find Lore now: not the police, not her family, and not the kidnappers who had left her in that alley to die. She had escaped...but the cost of her newfound freedom was crime and deception, and she paid it over and over again, until she had become someone she loathed.<br><br>Lore had a choice: She could stay in the shadows, stay with Spanner...and risk losing herself forever. Or she could leave Spanner and find herself again by becoming someone else: stealing the identity implant of a dead woman, taking over her life, and creating a new future. <br><br>But to start again, Lore required Spanner's talents--Spanner, who needed her and hated her, and who always had a price. And even as Lore agreed to play Spanner's game one final time, she found that there was still the price of being a Van Oesterling to be paid. Only by confronting her family, her past, and her own demons could Lore meld together who she had once been, who she had become, and the person she intended to be..."

    - "<I>Moving Mars</I> is a story of human courage and love set within the greater saga of a planetary liberation movement.\xC2\xA0 Mars is a colonial world, governed by corporate interests on Earth.\xC2\xA0 The citizens of Mars are hardworking, but held back by their lack of access to the best education, and the desire of the Earthly powers to keep the best new inventions for themselves.\xC2\xA0 The young Martians -- the second and third generations born on Mars -- have little loyalty to Earth, and a strong belief that their planet can be independent.\xC2\xA0 The revolution begins slowly, but will grow in power over decades of political struggle until it becomes irresistible.\xC2\xA0Told through the eyes of an extraordinary character, Casseia Majumdar, a daughter of one of Mars' oldest, most conservative Binding Multiples, <I>Moving Mars</I> is Greg Bear's brilliant conception of the human colonization of the red planet, with lovingly painted details and a grand historical sweep, embellishing an audacious scientific speculation."

    - Book
    - Kim Stanley Robinson
    - In his most ambitious project to date, award-winning author Kim Stanley Robinson utilizes years of research and cutting-edge science in the first of three novels that will chronicle the colonization of Mars.<P>For eons, sandstorms have swept the barren desolate landscape of the red planet. For centuries, Mars has beckoned to mankind to come and conquer its hostile climate. Now, in the year 2026, a group of one hundred colonists is about to fulfill that destiny.<P>John Boone, Maya Toitavna, Frank Chalmers, and Arkady Bogdanov lead a mission whose ultimate goal is the terraforming of Mars. For some, Mars will become a passion driving them to daring acts of courage and madness; for others it offers and opportunity to strip the planet of its riches. And for the genetic "alchemists, " Mars presents a chance to create a biomedical miracle, a breakthrough that could change all we know about life...and death.<P>The colonists place giant satellite mirrors in Martian orbit to reflect light to the planets surface. Black dust sprinkled on the polar caps will capture warmth and melt the ice. And massive tunnels, kilometers in depth, will be drilled into the Martian mantle to create stupendous vents of hot gases. Against this backdrop of epic upheaval, rivalries, loves, and friendships will form and fall to pieces--for there are those who will fight to the death to prevent Mars from ever being changed.<P>Brilliantly imagined, breathtaking in scope and ingenuity, <i>Red Mars</i> is an epic scientific saga, chronicling the next step in human evolution and creating a world in its entirety. <i>Red Mars</i> shows us a future, with both glory and tarnish, that awes with complexity and inspires with vision.

Joshua Kampa, is torn between two worlds-the Early Pleistocene Africa of his dreams and the twentieth-century reality of his waking life. These worlds are transposed when a government experiment sends him over a million years back in time. Here, John builds a new life as part of a tribe of protohumans. But the reality of early Africa is much more challenging than his fantasies. With the landscape, the species, and John himself evolving, he reaches a temporal crossroads where he must decide whether the past or the future will be his present.  "

    - "<P>In the far future, Earth is a worn-out backwater and humanity is spread across the galaxy on worlds that began as colonies, but now feel like home, each with its own long history of a thousand years or more, and each with its own unique culture. One of the strangest is on Borthan, where the founding settlers established the Covenant, which teaches that the self is to be despised, and forbids anyone to reveal his innermost thoughts or feelings to another. On Borthan, the filthiest obscenities imaginable are the words \xE2\x80\x9CI\xE2\x80\x9D and \xE2\x80\x9Cme.\xE2\x80\x9D For the heinous crime of \xE2\x80\x9Cself-baring,\xE2\x80\x9D apostates have always paid with exile or death, but after his eyes are opened by a visitor from Earth, Kinnall Darival, prince of Salla, risks everything to teach his people the real meaning of being human.<BR><BR>With a new introduction by the author, and the first-ever map of Borthan,\xC2\xA0this classic, out of print since 1992, is a fantastic new\xC2\xA0addition to\xC2\xA0the Orb imprint.</P>"

    - Book
    - Alexei Panshin
    - In 2198, one hundred and fifty years after the desperate wars that destroyed an overpopulated Earth, Man lives precariously on a hundred hastily-established colony worlds and in the seven giant Ships that once ferried men to the stars.     Mia Havero's Ship is a small closed society. It tests its children by casting them out to live or die in a month of Trial in the hostile wilds of a colony world. Mia Havero's Trial is fast approaching and in the meantime she must learn not only the skills that will keep her alive but the deeper courage to face herself and her world.    Published originally in 1968, Alexei Panshin's Nebula Award-winning classic has lost none of its relevance, with its keen exploration of societal stagnation and the resilience of youth.

    - Book
    - Steven Bach
    - "Back in print with a new introduction and epilogue by the author, this modern classic is \"one of the few indispensable books about Hollywood.\" --Jack Kroll, Newsweek. \"What altered Hollywood irrevocably was the notorious 1980 film Heaven's Gate.\" --Irwin Winkler, The New York Times, 1/14/99. Heaven's Gate is probably the most discussed, least seen film in modern movie history. Its notoriety is so great that it has become a generic term for disaster, for ego run rampant, for epic mismanagement, for wanton extravagance. It was also the watershed film of the '80s--not for its cinematic qualities, but for its effect on Hollywood and the way movies were and were not made for years afterward. For Michael Cimino's Heaven's Gate did not merely fail; the film did the unthinkable: it sank a studio. Less than a month after the picture's second release, United Artists--the company founded in 1919 by Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, D. W. Griffith, and Charlie Chaplin--for all practical purposes ceased to exist. What happened? Why? How? In answering these questions, combining wit, extraordinary anecdotes, and historical perspective, Steven Bach has produced a landmark book on Hollywood and its people, and in so doing, tells a story of human absurdity that would have made Chaplin proud."

    - "<strong>Winner of the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize: \xE2\x80\x9C[A] commanding and important book.\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94Jill Lepore, <em>The New Yorker</em></strong>  This epic work\xE2\x80\x94named a best book of the year by the <em>Washington Post</em>, <em>Time</em>, the <em>Los Angeles Times</em>, Amazon, the <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em>, and a notable book by the <em>New York Times</em>\xE2\x80\x94tells the story of the Hemingses, whose close blood ties to our third president had been systematically expunged from American history until very recently. Now, historian and legal scholar Annette Gordon-Reed traces the Hemings family from its origins in Virginia in the 1700s to the family\xE2\x80\x99s dispersal after Jefferson\xE2\x80\x99s death in 1826.<br />  <br />  In the mid-1700s the English captain of a trading ship that made runs between England and the Virginia colony fathered a child by an enslaved woman living near Williamsburg. The woman, whose name is unknown and who is believed to have been born in Africa, was owned by the Eppeses, a prominent Virginia family. The captain, whose surname was Hemings, and the woman had a daughter. They named her Elizabeth.<br />  <br />  So begins <em>The Hemingses of Monticello</em>, Annette Gordon-Reed\xE2\x80\x99s \xE2\x80\x9Criveting history\xE2\x80\x9D of the Hemings family, whose story comes to vivid life in this brilliantly researched and deeply moving work. Gordon-Reed, author of the highly acclaimed historiography <em>Thomas Jefferson and Sally Hemings: An American Controversy</em>, unearths startling new information about the Hemingses, Jefferson, and his white family. Although the book presents the most detailed and richly drawn portrait ever written of Sarah Hemings, better known by her nickname Sally, who bore seven children by Jefferson over the course of their thirty-eight-year liaison, <em>The Hemingses of Monticello</em> tells more than the story of her life with Jefferson and their children. The Hemingses as a whole take their rightful place in the narrative of the family\xE2\x80\x99s extraordinary engagement with one of history\xE2\x80\x99s most important figures.<br />  <br />  Not only do we meet Elizabeth Hemings\xE2\x80\x94the family matriarch and mother to twelve children, six by John Wayles, a poor English immigrant who rose to great wealth in the Virginia colony\xE2\x80\x94but we follow the Hemings family as they become the property of Jefferson through his marriage to Martha Wayles. The Hemings-Wayles children, siblings to Martha, played pivotal roles in the life at Jefferson\xE2\x80\x99s estate.<br />  <br />  We follow the Hemingses to Paris, where James Hemings trained as a chef in one of the most prestigious kitchens in France and where Sally arrived as a fourteen-year-old chaperone for Jefferson\xE2\x80\x99s daughter Polly; to Philadelphia, where James Hemings acted as the major domo to the newly appointed secretary of state; to Charlottesville, where Mary Hemings lived with her partner, a prosperous white merchant who left her and their children a home and property; to Richmond, where Robert Hemings engineered a plan for his freedom; and finally to Monticello, that iconic home on the mountain, from where most of Jefferson\xE2\x80\x99s slaves, many of them Hemings family members, were sold at auction six months after his death in 1826.<br />  <br />  As <em>The Hemingses of Monticello</em> makes vividly clear, Monticello can no longer be known only as the home of a remarkable American leader, the author of the Declaration of Independence; nor can the story of the Hemingses, whose close blood ties to our third president have been expunged from history until very recently, be left out of the telling of America\xE2\x80\x99s story. With its empathetic and insightful consideration of human beings acting in almost unimaginably difficult and complicated family circumstances, <em>The Hemingses of Monticello</em> is history as great literature. It is a remarkable achievement.<br />  <br /> 37 illustrations."

    - Book
    - Kevin Boyle
    - "<b>An electrifying story of the sensational murder trial that divided a city and ignited the civil rights struggle</b><br> <br>In 1925, Detroit was a smoky swirl of jazz and speakeasies, assembly lines and fistfights. The advent of automobiles had brought workers from around the globe to compete for manufacturing jobs, and tensions often flared with the KKK in ascendance and violence rising. Ossian Sweet, a proud Negro doctor-grandson of a slave-had made the long climb from the ghetto to a home of his own in a previously all-white neighborhood. Yet just after his arrival, a mob gathered outside his house; suddenly, shots rang out: Sweet, or one of his defenders, had accidentally killed one of the whites threatening their lives and homes. <br><br>And so it began-a chain of events that brought America's greatest attorney, Clarence Darrow, into the fray and transformed Sweet into a controversial symbol of equality. Historian Kevin Boyle weaves the police investigation and courtroom drama of Sweet's murder trial into an unforgettable tapestry of narrative history that documents the volatile America of the 1920s and movingly re-creates the Sweet family's journey from slavery through the Great Migration to the middle class. Ossian Sweet's story, so richly and poignantly captured here, is an epic tale of one man trapped by the battles of his era's changing times.<br>"

    - Book
    - Carlos Eire
    - <P> "Have mercy on me, Lord, I am Cuban." In 1962, Carlos Eire was one of 14,000 children airlifted out of Cuba -- exiled from his family, his country, and his own childhood by the revolution. The memories of Carlos's life in Havana, cut short when he was just eleven years old, are at the heart of this stunning, evocative, and unforgettable memoir.  <P> <I>Waiting for Snow in Havana</I> is both an exorcism and an ode to a paradise lost. For the Cuba of Carlos's youth -- with its lizards and turquoise seas and sun-drenched siestas -- becomes an island of condemnation once a cigar-smoking guerrilla named Fidel Castro ousts President Batista on January 1, 1959. Suddenly the music in the streets sounds like gunfire. Christmas is made illegal, political dissent leads to imprisonment, and too many of Carlos's friends are leaving Cuba for a place as far away and unthinkable as the United States. Carlos will end up there, too, and fulfill his mother's dreams by becoming a modern American man -- even if his soul remains in the country he left behind. <P> Narrated with the urgency of a confession, <I>Waiting for Snow in Havana</I> is a eulogy for a native land and a loving testament to the collective spirit of Cubans everywhere.

    - Robert A. Caro
    - "The most riveting political biography of our time, Robert A. Caro\xE2\x80\x99s  life of Lyndon B. Johnson,  continues. <b>Master of the Senate</b> takes Johnson\xE2\x80\x99s story through one of its most remarkable periods: his twelve years, from 1949 through 1960, in the United States Senate. Once the most august and revered body in politics, by the time Johnson arrived the Senate had become a parody of itself and an obstacle that for decades had blocked desperately needed liberal legislation. Caro shows how Johnson\xE2\x80\x99s brilliance, charm, and ruthlessness enabled him to become the youngest and most powerful Majority Leader in history and how he used his incomparable legislative genius--seducing both Northern liberals and Southern conservatives--to pass the first Civil Rights legislation since Reconstruction. Brilliantly weaving rich detail into a gripping narrative, Caro gives us both a galvanizing portrait of Johnson himself and a definitive and revelatory study of the workings of legislative power."

    - Book
    - Andrew Solomon
    - <P> <I>The Noonday Demon</I> examines depression in personal, cultural, and scientific terms. Drawing on his own struggles with the illness and interviews with fellow sufferers, doctors and scientists, policy makers and politicians, drug designers and philosophers, Andrew Solomon reveals the subtle complexities and sheer agony of the disease. He confronts the challenge of defining the illness and describes the vast range of available medications, the efficacy of alternative treatments, and the impact the malady has on various demographic populations -- around the world and throughout history. He also explores the thorny patch of moral and ethical questions posed by emerging biological explanations for mental illness. With uncommon humanity, candor, wit, and erudition, award-winning author Solomon takes readers on a journey of incom-parable range and resonance into the most pervasive of family secrets. His contribution to our understanding not only of mental illness but also of the human condition is truly stunning.

    - Book
    - Nathaniel Philbrick
    - The ordeal of the whaleship Essex was an event as mythic  in the nineteenth century as the sinking of the <i>Titanic</i> was in  the twentieth. In 1819, the <i>Essex</i> left Nantucket for the South  Pacific with twenty crew members aboard. In the middle of the South  Pacific the ship was rammed and sunk by an angry sperm whale. The crew  drifted for more than ninety days in three tiny whaleboats, succumbing  to weather, hunger, disease, and ultimately turning to drastic  measures in the fight for survival. Nathaniel Philbrick uses  little-known documents-including a long-lost account written by the  ship's cabin boy-and penetrating details about whaling and the  Nantucket community to reveal the chilling events surrounding this  epic maritime disaster. An intense and mesmerizing read, <i>In the  Heart of the Sea</i> is a monumental work of history forever placing  the Essex tragedy in the American historical canon.

    - Book
    - John W. Dower
    - <B>Winner of the 1999 National Book Award for Non-Fiction</B>, finalist for the Lionel Gelber Prize and the Kiriyama Pacific Rim Book Prize, <I>Embracing Defeat</I> is John W. Dower's brilliant examination of Japan in the immediate, shattering aftermath of World War II. Drawing on a vast range of Japanese sources and illustrated with dozens of astonishing documentary photographs, <I>Embracing Defeat</I> is the fullest and most important history of the more than six years of American occupation, which affected every level of Japanese society, often in ways neither side could anticipate. Dower, whom Stephen E. Ambrose has called "America's foremost historian of the Second World War in the Pacific," gives us the rich and turbulent interplay between West and East, the victor and the vanquished, in a way never before attempted, from top-level manipulations concerning the fate of Emperor Hirohito to the hopes and fears of men and women in every walk of life. Already regarded as the benchmark in its field, <I>Embracing Defeat</I> is a work of colossal scholarship and history of the very first order.

    - Joseph J. Ellis
    - At different times Thomas Jefferson has been claimed by Southern secessionists and Northern abolitionists, New Deal liberals and neoconservatives  Now historian Joseph J. Ellis restores our most elusive national icon to human dimensions with insight, sympathy, and superb style, shrewdly sifting the facts from the legends and the rumors. From the drafting of the Declaration of Independence to his retirement in Monticello, Ellis unravels the contradictions of his character, giving us the slaveholding libertarian, the enemy of government power who exercised it audaciously as president; and the visionary who remained blind to his own inconsistencies.  A marvel of scholarship and a delight to read, <b>American Sphinx</b> is a book whose appeal transcends history buffs and biography fans and provides an essential gloss on the Jeffersonian legacy.

It deals with three distinct forms of freedom: personal freedom; civic freedom (the right to participate in public life); and sovereign freedom (the right to exercise power over others). The book examines the relationships between the idea of freedom and the institution, and argues that women, as domestic slaves and the spoils of war, were the first to articulate the cry for personal liberty."

    - "The House of Morgan: An American Banking Dynasty and the Rise of Modern Finance"
    - Book
    - Ron Chernow
    - The winner of the National Book Award and now considered a classic, The House of Morgan is the most ambitious history ever written about an American banking dynasty. Acclaimed by The Wall Street Journal as "brilliantly researched and written," the book tells the rich, panoramic story of four generations of Morgans and the powerful, secretive firms they spawned. It is the definitive account of the rise of the modern financial world. A gripping history of banking and the booms and busts that shaped the world on both sides of the Atlantic, The House of Morgan traces the trajectory of the J. P. Morgan empire from its obscure beginnings in Victorian London to the crash of 1987. Ron Chernow paints a fascinating portrait of the private saga of the Morgans and the rarefied world of the American and British elite in which they moved. Based on extensive interviews and access to the family and business archives, The House of Morgan is an investigative masterpiece, a compelling account of a remarkable institution and the men who ran it, and an essential book for understanding the money and power behind the major historical events of the last 150 years.

    - Book
    - Barry Lopez
    - Barry Lopez's National Book Award-winning classic study of the Far North is widely considered his masterpiece.<br><br>Lopez offers a thorough examination of this obscure world-its terrain, its wildlife, its history of Eskimo natives and intrepid explorers who have arrived on their icy shores. But what turns this marvelous work of natural history into a breathtaking study of profound originality is his unique meditation on how the landscape can shape our imagination, desires, and dreams. Its prose as hauntingly pure as the land it describes, Arctic Dreams is nothing less than an indelible classic of modern literature. <br>

    - Book
    - Harriet A. Washington
    - "<b>From the era of slavery to the present day, the first full history of black America\xE2\x80\x99s shocking mistreatment as unwilling and unwitting experimental subjects at the hands of the medical establishment.<br></b><br><i>Medical Apartheid</i> is the first and only comprehensive history of medical experimentation on African Americans. Starting with the earliest encounters between black Americans and Western medical researchers and the racist pseudoscience that resulted, it details the ways both slaves and freedmen were used in hospitals for experiments conducted without their knowledge\xE2\x80\x94a tradition that continues today within some black populations. It reveals how blacks have historically been prey to grave-robbing as well as unauthorized autopsies and dissections. Moving into the twentieth century, it shows how the pseudoscience of eugenics and social Darwinism was used to justify experimental exploitation and shoddy medical treatment of blacks, and the view that they were biologically inferior, oversexed, and unfit for adult responsibilities. Shocking new details about the government\xE2\x80\x99s notorious Tuskegee experiment are revealed, as are similar, less-well-known medical atrocities conducted by the government, the armed forces, prisons, and private institutions.<br>The product of years of prodigious research into medical journals and experimental reports long undisturbed, <i>Medical Apartheid</i> reveals the hidden underbelly of scientific research and makes possible, for the first time, an understanding of the roots of the African American health deficit. At last, it provides the fullest possible context for comprehending the behavioral fallout that has caused black Americans to view researchers\xE2\x80\x94and indeed the whole medical establishment\xE2\x80\x94with such deep distrust. No one concerned with issues of public health and racial justice can afford not to read <i>Medical Apartheid</i>, a masterful book that will stir up both controversy and long-needed debate."

    - Simon Schama
    - "<blockquote><center> <p> <i>Rough Crossings</i> turns on a single huge question: if you were black in America at the start of the Revolutionary War, who would you want to win? </p> </center></blockquote> <p> Tens of thousands gave their answer, voting with their feet for Britain and King George. In response to a declaration by the last governor of Virginia that any rebel-owned slave who escaped and served the King would be emancipated, tens of thousands of slaves-Americans who clung to the sentimental notion of British freedom -- escaped from farms, plantations, and cities to try to reach the British camp. This mass movement lasted as long as the war did, and a military strategy originally designed to break the plantations of the American South had unleashed one of the great exoduses in American history. </p> <p> With powerfully vivid storytelling, often in the voices of the slaves themselves and the white abolitionists who became their emancipators and protectors, Schama details the odyssey of the escaped blacks through the fires of war and the terror of potential recapture at the war's end, into inhospitable Nova Scotia, where thousands who had served the Crown were betrayed and, in a little-known hegira of the slave epic, sent across the broad, stormy ocean to Sierra Leone. </p>"

    - They stand as unselfconscious as if the photograph were being taken at a church picnic and not during one of the pitched battles of the civil rights struggle. None of them knows that the image will appear in <i>Life </i>magazine<i> </i>or that it will become an icon of its era. The year is 1962, and these seven white Mississippi lawmen have gathered to stop James Meredith from integrating the University of Mississippi. One of them is swinging a billy club. <br><br>More than thirty years later, award-winning journalist and author Paul Hendrickson sets out to discover who these men were, what happened to them after the photograph was taken, and how racist attitudes shaped the way they lived their lives. But his ultimate focus is on their children and grandchildren, and how the prejudice bequeathed by the fathers was transformed, or remained untouched, in the sons. <b>Sons of Mississippi</b> is a scalding yet redemptive work of social history, a book of eloquence and subtlely that tracks the movement of racism across three generations and bears witness to its ravages among both black and white Americans.

Literate and authoritative--.Marvelously exciting.\" --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>Jonathan Weiner, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for <b>The Beak of the Finch</b>, brings his brilliant reporting skills to the story of Seymour Benzer, the Brooklyn-born maverick scientist whose study of genetics and experiments with fruit fly genes has helped revolutionize or knowledge of the connections between DNA and behavior both animal and human.<br><br>How much of our fate is decided before we are born?  Which of our characteristics is inscribed in our DNA? Weiner brings us into Benzer's Fly Rooms at the California Institute of Technology, where Benzer, and his asssociates are in the process of finding answers, often astonishing ones, to these questions. Part biography, part thrilling scientific detective story, <b>Time, Love, Memory</b> forcefully demonstrates how Benzer's studies are changing our world view--and even our lives."

    - Book
    - Philip Gourevitch
    - <b>Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction.</b><br><br>In April 1994, the Rwandan government called upon everyone in the Hutu majority to kill each member of the Tutsi minority, and over the next three months 800,000 Tutsis perished in the most unambiguous case of genocide since Hitler's war against the Jews. Philip Gourevitch's haunting work is an anatomy of the war in Rwanda, a vivid history of the tragedy's background, and an unforgettable account of its aftermath. One of the most acclaimed books of the year, this account will endure as a chilling document of our time. <br>

    - Anne Fadiman
    - "Winner of the National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction<br><br>When three-month-old Lia Lee Arrived at the county  hospital emergency room in Merced, California, a chain of events was set in motion from which neither she nor her parents nor her doctors would ever recover. Lia's parents, Foua and Nao Kao, were part of a large Hmong community in Merced, refugees from the CIA-run \"Quiet War\" in Laos. The Hmong, traditionally a close-knit and fiercely people, have been less amenable to assimilation than most immigrants, adhering steadfastly to the rituals and beliefs of their ancestors. Lia's pediatricians, Neil Ernst and his wife, Peggy Philip, cleaved just as strongly to another tradition: that of Western medicine. When Lia Lee Entered the American medical system, diagnosed as an epileptic, her story became a tragic case history of cultural miscommunication.<br><br>Parents and doctors both wanted the best for Lia, but their ideas about the causes of her illness and its treatment could hardly have been more different. The Hmong see illness aand healing as spiritual matters linked to virtually everything in the universe, while medical community marks a division between body and soul, and concerns itself almost exclusively with the former. Lia's doctors ascribed her seizures to the misfiring of her cerebral neurons; her parents called her illness, <i>qaug dab peg</i>--the spirit catches you and you fall down--and ascribed it to the wandering of her soul. The doctors prescribed anticonvulsants; her parents preferred animal sacrifices. <br>"

    - "<br>A New York Times Editors' Choice for Book of the Year<br>Winner of the Pacific Northwest Booksellers Award<br>Winner of the PEN West Creative Nonfiction Award<br><br><br>\"No one has evoked with greater power the marriage of land and sky that gives this country both its beauty and its terror. \"<br>--Washington Post Book World<br><br>In 1909 maps still identified eastern Montana as the Great American Desert.  But in that year Congress, lobbied heavily by railroad companies, offered 320-acre tracts of land to anyone bold or foolish enough to stake a claim to them. Drawn by shamelessly inventive brochures, countless homesteaders--many of them immigrants--went west to make their fortunes. Most failed. In Bad Land, Jonathan Raban travels through the unforgiving country that was the scene of their dreams and undoing, and makes their story come miraculously alive.     <br><br>In towns named Terry, Calypso, and Ismay (which changed its name to Joe, Montana, in an effort to attract football fans), and in the landscape in between, Raban unearths a vanished episode of American history, with its own ruins, its own heroes and heroines, its own hopeful myths and bitter memories. Startlingly observed, beautifully written, this book is a contemporary classic of the American West. <br><br>\"Exceptional. . . .  A beautifully told historical meditation. \"<br>--Time<br><br>\"Championship prose. . . .  In fifty years don't be surprised if Bad Land is a landmark.\"<br>--Los Angeles Times "

Now, the book that reignited the feminist movement is back in a fifteenth anniversary edition, with a new preface by the author that brings backlash consciousness up to date.  <br><br>When it was first published, <i>Backlash</i> made headlines for puncturing such favorite media myths as the \xE2\x80\x9Cinfertility epidemic\xE2\x80\x9D and the \xE2\x80\x9Cman shortage,\xE2\x80\x9D myths that defied statistical realities. These willfully fictitious media campaigns added up to an antifeminist backlash. Whatever progress feminism has recently made, Faludi\xE2\x80\x99s words today seem prophetic. The media still love stories about stay-at-home moms and the \xE2\x80\x9Cdangers\xE2\x80\x9D of women\xE2\x80\x99s career ambitions; the glass ceiling is still low; women are still punished for wanting to succeed; basic reproductive rights are still hanging by a thread. The backlash clearly exists.<br><br>With passion and precision, Faludi shows in her new preface how the creators of commercial culture distort feminist concepts to sell products while selling women downstream, how the feminist ethic of economic independence is twisted into the consumer ethic of buying power, and how the feminist quest for self-determination is warped into a self-centered quest for self-improvement. <i>Backlash</i> is a classic of feminism, an alarm bell for women of every generation, reminding us of the dangers that we still face."

Worshipped as a religious icon by the fanatical Fremens, Paul faces the enmity of the political houses he displaced when he assumed the throne-and a conspiracy conducted within his own sphere of influence. <br/><br/> And even as House Atreides begins to crumble around him from the machinations of his enemies, the true threat to Paul comes to his lover, Chani, and the unborn heir to his family's dynasty.

    - WHAT THE BLEEP DO WE KNOW?! is a new type of film. It is part documentary, part story, and part elaborate and inspiring visual effects and animations. The protagonist, Amanda, played by Marlee Matlin, finds herself in a fantastic Alice in Wonderland experience when her daily, uninspired life literally begins to unravel, revealing the uncertain world of the quantum field hidden behind what we consider to be our normal, waking reality. She is literally plunged into a swirl of chaotic occurrences, while the characters she encounters on this odyssey reveal the deeper, hidden knowledge she doesn?t even realize she has asked for. Like every hero, Amanda is thrown into crisis, questioning the fundamental premises of her life ? that the reality she has believed in about how men are, how relationships with others should be, and how her emotions are affecting her work isn?t reality at all!

Beginning with simple and clear explanations of major concepts of physics, including gravity, electromagnetism, and relativity, The Elegant Universe illuminates one of the most revolutionary theories in physics today.    <P>Known as string theory or superstring theory, this startling idea proposes that the fundamental ingredients of nature are inconceivably tiny strands of energy, whose different modes of vibration underlie everything that happens in the universe.

In his classic <I>The Age of Spiritual   Machines</I>, he argued that computers would soon rival the full range of human intelligence at   its best. Now he examines the next step in this inexorable evolutionary process: the union of   human and machine, in which the knowledge and skills embedded in our brains will be combined   with the vastly greater capacity, speed, and knowledge-sharing ability of our creations."

History teaches us that a third of Europe\xE2\x80\x99s population was destroyed. But what if? What if the plague killed 99 percent of the population instead? How would the world have changed? This is a look at the history that could have been\xE2\x80\x93a history that stretches across centuries, a history that sees dynasties and nations rise and crumble, a history that spans horrible famine and magnificent innovation. These are the years of rice and salt. <br><br>This is a universe where the first ship to reach the New World travels across the Pacific Ocean from China and colonization spreads from west to east.

    - Ervin Laszlo
    - "Presents the unifying world-concept long sought by scientists, mystics, and sages: an Integral Theory of Everything <br /><br />\xE2\x80\xA2 Explains how modern science has rediscovered the Akashic Field of perennial philosophy <br /><br />\xE2\x80\xA2 New edition updates ongoing scientific studies, presents new research inspired by the first edition, and includes new case studies and a section on animal telepathy <br /><br />Mystics and sages have long maintained that there exists an interconnecting cosmic field at the roots of reality that conserves and conveys information, a field known as the Akashic record. Recent discoveries in vacuum physics show that this Akashic Field is real and has its equivalent in science\xE2\x80\x99s zero-point field that underlies space itself. This field consists of a subtle sea of fluctuating energies from which all things arise: atoms and galaxies, stars and planets, living beings, and even consciousness. This zero-point Akashic Field is the constant and enduring memory of the universe. It holds the record of all that has happened on Earth and in the cosmos and relates it to all that is yet to happen. <br /><br />In <em>Science and the Akashic Field</em>, philosopher and scientist Ervin Laszlo conveys the essential element of this information field in language that is accessible and clear. From the world of science he confirms our deepest intuitions of the oneness of creation in the Integral Theory of Everything. We discover that, as philosopher William James stated, \xE2\x80\x9CWe are like islands in the sea, separate on the surface but connected in the deep.\xE2\x80\x9D <br />"

A relentless failure, Nelson has botched nearly every scheme he's attempted to pull off. Now his future lies in a potentially profitable marijuana patch hidden in the lush old-growth redwoods on the family land. <p>Nelson has some serious problems. His marriage has fallen apart, and he may lose his land, cash and crop in the divorce. What's more, in need of some quick cash, he had foolishly agreed to smuggle $90,000 worth of cocaine through customs for Harry Lally, a major player in a drug syndicate. Chickening out just before bringing the drugs through, he flushed the powder. Now Lally wants him dead, and two goons are hot on his trail. Desperate, terrified and alone, for Nelson, there may be only one way out.<P> This is Denis Johnson's biggest and most complex book to date, and it perfectly showcases his signature themes of fate, redemption and the unraveling of the fabric of today's society. <I>Already Dead,</I> with its masterful narrative of overlapping and entwined stories, will further fuel the acclaim that surrounds one of today's most fascinating writers.

She is leaving the foreign service and her lover at the same time. But before she departs the U.S. embassy in Madrid for home, a well-known American writer shows up with a strange request. Vicky knows that what the writer wants from her is not necessarily what he is asking. But curiosity leads her to play along, and she is quickly drawn into the murky underground of terrorists and spies into which the writer himself has been reluctantly led. The track she takes is full of wrong turns. And at the end of the tunnel, it's not light she sees but an unspeakable threat to people she loves.<P>Recalling Graham Greene in <I>The Comedians,</I> Jacobs weaves an engrossing story that takes place over three continents and illuminates the unexpected ways people betray and defend one another and, ultimately, how they learn to love.

But as Harry enters his fifth year at wizard school,  it seems those bonds have never been more sorely tested. Lord  Voldemort\xE2\x80\x99s rise has opened a rift in the wizarding world between  those who believe the truth about his return, and those who prefer to  believe it\xE2\x80\x99s all madness and lies--just more trouble from  Harry Potter.    <P>Add to this a host of other worries for Harry\xE2\x80\xA6<BR>   \xE2\x80\xA2 A Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher with a personality like poisoned honey<BR>   \xE2\x80\xA2 A venomous, disgruntled house-elf<BR>   \xE2\x80\xA2 Ron as keeper of the Gryffindor Quidditch team<BR>   \xE2\x80\xA2 And of course, what every student dreads: end-of-term Ordinary Wizarding Level exams    <P>\xE2\x80\xA6and you\xE2\x80\x99d know what Harry faces during the day. But at  night it\xE2\x80\x99s even worse, because then he dreams of a single door in a  silent corridor. And this door is somehow more terrifying than every  other nightmare combined.    <P>In the richest installment yet of J. K. Rowling\xE2\x80\x99s seven-part  story, Harry Potter confronts the unreliability of the very government  of the magical world, and the impotence of the authorities at  Hogwarts.    <P>Despite this (or perhaps because of it) Harry finds depth and strength  in his friends, beyond what even he knew; boundless loyalty and  unbearable sacrifice.    <P>Though thick runs the plot (as well as the spine), readers will  race through these pages, and leave Hogwarts, like Harry, wishing only  for the next train back."

    - Book
    - Richard Holmes
    - "A riveting history of the men and women whose discoveries and inventions at the end of the eighteenth century gave birth to the Romantic Age of Science. <br><br>When young Joseph Banks stepped onto a Tahitian beach in 1769, he hoped to discover Paradise. Inspired by the scientific ferment sweeping through Britain, the botanist had sailed with Captain Cook on his first <i>Endeavour </i>voyage in search of new worlds. Other voyages of discovery\xE2\x80\x94astronomical, chemical, poetical, philosophical\xE2\x80\x94swiftly follow in Richard Holmes\xE2\x80\x99s original evocation of what truly emerges as an Age of Wonder. <br><br>Brilliantly conceived as a relay of scientific stories, <i>The Age of Wonder</i> investigates the earliest ideas of deep time and space, and the explorers of \xE2\x80\x9Cdynamic science,\xE2\x80\x9D of an infinite, mysterious Nature waiting to be discovered. Three lives dominate the book: William Herschel and his sister Caroline, whose dedication to the study of the stars forever changed the public conception of the solar system, the Milky Way, and the meaning of the universe; and Humphry Davy, who, with only a grammar school education stunned the scientific community with his near-suicidal gas experiments that led to the invention of the miners\xE2\x80\x99 lamp and established British chemistry as the leading professional science in Europe.  This age of exploration extended to great writers and poets as well as scientists, all creators relishing in moments of high exhilaration, boundary-pushing and discovery. <br><br>Holmes\xE2\x80\x99s extraordinary evocation of this age of wonder shows how great ideas and experiments\xE2\x80\x94both successes and failures\xE2\x80\x94were born of singular and often lonely dedication, and how religious faith and scientific truth collide.  He has written a book breathtaking in its originality, its storytelling energy, and  its intellectual significance."

    - Book
    - Mark Lynas
    - Possibly the most graphic treatment of global warming that has yet been published, <i>Six Degrees</i> is what readers of Al Gore's best-selling <i>An Inconvenient Truth</i> or Ross Gelbspan's <i>Boiling Point</i> will turn to next. Written by the acclaimed author of <i>High Tide</i>, this highly relevant and compelling book uses accessible journalistic prose to distill what environmental scientists portend about the consequences of human pollution for the next hundred years.<br><br>In 2001, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) released a landmark report projecting average global surface temperatures to rise between 1.4 degrees and 5.8 degrees Celsius (roughly 2 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit) by the end of this century. Based on this forecast, author Mark Lynas outlines what to expect from a warming world, degree by degree. At 1 degree Celsius, most coral reefs and many mountain glaciers will be lost. A 3-degree rise would spell the collapse of the Amazon rainforest, disappearance of Greenland's ice sheet, and the creation of deserts across the Midwestern United States and southern Africa. A 6-degree increase would eliminate most life on Earth, including much of humanity.<br><br>Based on authoritative scientific articles, the latest computer models, and information about past warm events in Earth history, <i>Six Degrees</i> promises to be an eye-opening warning that humanity will ignore at its peril.

    - "\xE2\x80\xA2  Why are lovers quicker to forgive their partners for infidelity than for leaving dirty dishes in the sink?<br><br>\xE2\x80\xA2  Why will sighted people pay more to avoid going blind than blind people will pay to regain their sight? <br><br>\xE2\x80\xA2  Why do dining companions insist on ordering different meals instead of getting what they really want? <br><br>\xE2\x80\xA2  Why do pigeons seem to have such excellent aim; why can\xE2\x80\x99t we remember one song while listening to another; and why does the line at   the grocery store always slow down the moment we join it?<br><br>In this brilliant, witty, and accessible book, renowned Harvard psychologist Daniel Gilbert describes the foibles of imagination and illusions of foresight that cause each of us to misconceive our tomorrows and misestimate our satisfactions. Vividly bringing to life the latest scientific research in psychology, cognitive neuroscience, philosophy, and behavioral economics, Gilbert reveals what scientists have discovered about the uniquely human ability to imagine the future, and about our capacity to predict how much we will like it when we get there. With penetrating insight and sparkling prose, Gilbert explains why we seem to know so little about the hearts and minds of the people we are about to become."

    - Book
    - David Bodanis
    - "In <i>Electric Universe</i>, David Bodanis weaves tales of romance, divine inspiration, and fraud through a lucid account of the invisible force that permeates our universe. In these pages the virtuoso scientists who plumbed the secrets of electricity come vividly to life, including familiar giants like Thomas Edison; the visionary Michael Faraday, who struggled against the prejudices of the British class system; and Samuel Morse, a painter who, before inventing the telegraph, ran for mayor of New York on a platform of persecuting Catholics. Here too is Alan Turing, whose dream of a marvelous thinking machine\xE2\x80\x94what we know as the computer\xE2\x80\x94was met with indifference, and who ended his life in despair after British authorities forced him to undergo experimental treatments to \xE2\x80\x9Ccure\xE2\x80\x9D his homosexuality. <br><br>From the frigid waters of the Atlantic to the streets of Hamburg during a World War II firestorm to the interior of the human body, <i>Electric Universe</i> is a mesmerizing journey of discovery by a master science writer."

    - "Critical Mass: How One Thing Leads to Another"
    - Book
    - Philip Ball
    - "Are there \xE2\x80\x9Cnatural laws\xE2\x80\x9D that govern the ways in which humans behave and organize themselves, just as there are physical laws that govern the motions of atoms and planets? Unlikely as it may seem, such laws now seem to be emerging from attempts to bring the tools and concepts of physics into the social sciences. These new discoveries are part of an old tradition. In the seventeenth century the philosopher Thomas Hobbes, dismayed by the impending civil war in England, decided that he would work out what kind of government was needed for a stable society. His solution sparked a new way of thinking about human behavior in looking for the \xE2\x80\x9Cscientific\xE2\x80\x9D rules of society.\xC2\xA0Adam Smith, Immanuel Kant, Auguste Comte, and John Stuart Mill pursued this idea from different political perspectives. But these philosophers lacked the tools that modern physics can now bring to bear on the matter. Philip Ball shows how, by using these tools, we can understand many aspects of mass human behavior. Once we recognize that we do not make most of our decisions in isolation but are affected by what others decide, we can start to discern a surprising and perhaps even disturbing predictability in our laws, institutions, and customs.\xC2\xA0Lively and compelling, <I>Critical Mass </I>is the first book to bring these new ideas together and to show how they fit within the broader historical context of a rational search for better ways to live."

    - "One of the world\xE2\x80\x99s most beloved and bestselling writers takes his ultimate journey -- into the most intriguing and intractable questions that science seeks to answer.<br><br>In <b>A Walk in the Woods</b>, Bill Bryson trekked the Appalachian Trail -- well, most of it. In <b>In A Sunburned Country</b>, he confronted some of the most lethal wildlife Australia has to offer. Now, in his biggest book, he confronts his greatest challenge: to understand -- and, if possible, answer -- the oldest, biggest questions we have posed about the universe and ourselves. Taking as territory everything from the Big Bang to the rise of civilization, Bryson seeks to understand how we got from there being nothing at all to there being us. To that end, he has attached himself to a host of the world\xE2\x80\x99s most advanced (and often obsessed) archaeologists, anthropologists, and mathematicians, travelling to their offices, laboratories, and field camps. He has read (or tried to read) their books, pestered them with questions, apprenticed himself to their powerful minds. <b>A Short History of Nearly Everything</b><i> </i>is the record of this quest, and it is a sometimes profound, sometimes funny, and always supremely clear and entertaining adventure in the realms of human knowledge, as only Bill Bryson can render it.

    - Book
    - Chris McManus
    - "\"A labor of love and enthusiasm as well as deep scientific knowledge, <i>Right Hand, Left Hand</i> takes the reader on a trip through history, around the world, and into the cosmos, to explore the place of handedness in nature and culture. Chris McManus considers evidence from anthropology, particle physics, the history of medicine, and the notebooks of Leonardo to answer questions like: Why are most people right-handed? Are left-handed people cognitively different from right-handers? Why is the heart almost always on the left side of the body? Why does European writing go from left to right, while Arabic and Hebrew go from right to left? Why do tornadoes spin counter-clockwise in the northern hemisphere and clockwise in the southern hemisphere? And how do we know that Jack the Ripper was left-handed?</p><P>McManus reminds readers that distinctions between right and left have been profoundly meaningful--imbued with moral and religious meaning--in societies throughout history, and suggests that our preoccupation with laterality may originate in our asymmetric bodies, which emerged from 550 million years of asymmetric vertebrate evolution, and may even be linked to the asymmetric structure of matter. With speculations embedded in science, <i>Right Hand, Left Hand</i> offers entertainment and new insight to scientists and general readers alike.\""

    - "Mapping the Deep: The Extraordinary Story of Ocean Science"
    - Book
    - Robert Kunzig
    - A vivid, up-to-date tour of the Earth's last frontier, a remote and mysterious realm that nonetheless lies close to the heart of even the most land-locked reader. The sea covers seven-tenths of the Earth, but we have mapped only a small percentage of it. The sea contains millions of species of animals and plants, but we have identified only a few thousand of them. The sea controls our planet's climate, but we do not really understand how. The sea is still the frontier, and yet it seems so familiar that we sometimes forget how little we know about it. Just as we are poised on the verge of exploiting the sea on an unprecedented scale-mining it, fertilizing it, fishing it out-this book reminds us of how much we have yet to learn. More than that, it chronicles the knowledge explosion that has transformed our view of the sea in just the past few decades, and made it a far more interesting and accessible place. From the Big Bang to that far-off future time, two billion years from now, when our planet will be a waterless rock; from the lush crowds of life at seafloor hot springs to the invisible, jewel-like plants that float at the sea surface; from the restless shifting of the tectonic plates to the majestic sweep of the ocean currents, Kunzig's clear and lyrical prose transports us to the ends of the Earth. 8 pages of color, 20 black-and-white illustrations. Originally published in hardcover as <I>The Restless Sea</I>.

    - Book
    - Brian Greene
    - "A new edition of the <I>New York Times</I> bestseller\xE2\x80\x94now a three-part <I>Nova</I> special on PBS-TV coming in Fall 2003: a fascinating and thought-provoking journey through the mysteries of space, time, and matter.    <P>Now with a new preface (not in any other edition) that will review the enormous public reception of the relatively obscure string theory\xE2\x80\x94made possible by this book and an increased number of adherents amongst physicists\xE2\x80\x94<I>The Elegant Universe</I> \"sets a standard that will be hard to beat\" (<I>New York Times Book Review</I>). Brian Greene, one of the world's leading string theorists, peels away the layers of mystery surrounding string theory to reveal a universe that consists of eleven dimensions, where the fabric of space tears and repairs itself, and all matter\xE2\x80\x94from the smallest quarks to the most gargantuan supernovas\xE2\x80\x94is generated by the vibrations of microscopically tiny loops of energy.    <P>Today physicists and mathematicians throughout the world are feverishly working on one of the most ambitious theories ever proposed: superstring theory. String theory, as it is often called, is the key to the Unified Field Theory that eluded Einstein for more than thirty years. Finally, the century-old antagonism between the large and the small-General Relativity and Quantum Theory-is resolved. String theory proclaims that all of the wondrous happenings in the universe, from the frantic dancing of subatomic quarks to the majestic swirling of heavenly galaxies, are reflections of one grand physical principle and manifestations of one single entity: microscopically tiny vibrating loops of energy, a billionth of a billionth the size of an atom. In this brilliantly articulated and refreshingly clear book, Greene relates the scientific story and the human struggle behind twentieth-century physics' search for a theory of everything.     <P>Through the masterful use of metaphor and analogy, <I>The Elegant Universe</I> makes some of the most sophisticated concepts ever contemplated viscerally accessible and thoroughly entertaining, bringing us closer than ever to understanding how the universe works."

    - Book
    - John Emsley
    - "How many top-selling perfumes are made entirely from synthetic chemicals? Are artificial sweeteners perfectly safe? Which has more saturated fat: butter or coconut oil? How many people have died by being poisoned with the world's most toxic chemicals, the dioxins? Does PVC packaging and plastic wrap cause cancer by contaminating food? Is nitrate from fertilizers polluting drinking water and causing \"blue-baby syndrome\" and stomach cancer? Is carbon dioxide from fossil fuels really the main cause of global warming? The unexpected answers to these and many other topical questions can be found in \"The Consumer's Good Chemical Guide\", which exposes the misinformation and misinformation that surround many of the controversial chemicals we meet in daily life. The guide explains in accessible, non-technical language the science behind sugar and artificial sweeteners; cholesterol, animal fats and fibre; painkillers, and the risks associated with taking drugs; plastics and PVC; dioxins and nitrates in the environment; and carbon dioxide and the greenhouse gases. Also included are chapters on two products which are entirely chemical, but commonly not thought of as such: perfume and alcohol.  Here, the reader discovers that not only do fragrance chemicals give a great deal of innocent pleasure, but that their synthetic versions have been responsible for reducing the large-scale slaughter of some wild animals; and that alcohol can not only improve the quality of life, it may even prolong it. \"The Consumer's Good Chemical Guide\" is for anyone, with or without a scientific background, who has been worried, sometimes alarmed, by stories which suggest that these chemicals are dangerous, polluting or unhealthy. This book won the general section of the Rhone-Poulenc Prize for Science in 1995."

    - The Making of Memory
    - Book
    - Steven P. R. Rose
    - The human brain weighs, on average, just over two pounds, is wrinkled like a walnut and has the colour and something of the consistency of porridge. Yet somehow the interactions of the ten billion cells that comprise it produce our capacity to think, hope, believe, imagine, and also to remember - to learn and recall, perhaps years later, a face, a tune, a poem or a telephone number. Are there molecules of memory? Can we understand the brain best as a computer? What light do diseases of memory shed on its mechanism? What is it, locked into the interactions of the brain cells and the molecules composing them, that carries the memories which make each person unique? Deciphering this, Steven Rose argues, is the key to interpreting the links between brain and mind. In this book he traces the road to a new understanding of memory that he and other researchers have followed, with all its false turnings and misleading signposts.  One of the aims of the book is to explore, through a description of the laboratory life of memory researchers, how scientists, in a world not free from political rivalry, ideology and self-deception, nevertheless strive to answer an important and fascinating question. The winner of the Rhone-Poulenc Science Prize 1993.

    - Book
    - Roger Penrose
    - For decades, proponents of artificial intelligence have argued that computers will soon be doing everything that a human mind can do. Admittedly, computers now play chess at the grandmaster level, but do they understand the game as we do?  Can a computer eventually do everything a human mind can do? In this absorbing and frequently contentious book, Roger Penrose--eminent physicist and winner, with Stephen Hawking, of the prestigious Wolf prize--puts forward his view that there are some facets of human thinking that can never be emulated by a machine. Penrose examines what physics and mathematics can tell us about how the mind works, what they can't, and what we need to know to understand the physical processes of consciousness. He is among a growing number of physicists who think Einstein wasn't being stubborn when he said his "little finger" told him that quantum mechanics is incomplete, and he concludes that laws even deeper than quantum mechanics are essential for the operation of a mind.  To support this contention, Penrose takes the reader on a dazzling tour that covers such topics as complex numbers, Turing machines, complexity theory, quantum mechanics, formal systems, Godel undecidability, phase spaces, Hilbert spaces, black holes, white holes, Hawking radiation, entropy, quasicrystals, the structure of the brain, and scores of other subjects. The Emperor's New Mind will appeal to anyone with a serious interest in modern physics and its  relation to philosophical issues, as well as to physicists, mathematicians, philosophers and those on either side of the AI debate.

    - Book
    - Roger Lewin
    - <i>Bones of Contention</i> is a behind-the-scenes look at the search for human origins.   Analyzing how the biases and preconceptions of paleoanthropologists shaped their work,   Roger Lewin's detective stories about the discovery of Neanderthal Man, the Taung Child,   Lucy, and other major fossils provide insight into this most subjective of scientific endeavors.   The new afterword looks at ways in which paleoanthropology, while becoming more scientific   in many ways, remains contentious.     <P>"[An] un-put-downable book."--John Gribbon, <i>Times Educational Supplement</i>     <P>"Not just another 'stones and bones' account of human evolution. It is Lewin's thesis, amply   demonstrated, that paleoanthropology is the most subjective of sciences because it engages   the emotions of virtually everyone; and since the evidence is scrappy, interpretation is   everything. . . . A splendid, stirring, and eye-opening account, to be devoured."--<i>Kirkus   Reviews,</i> starred review     <P>"[Lewin shows] 'how very unscientific the process of scientific inquiry can be.'. . . <i>Bones of   Contention</i> is . . . serious intellectual history."--Edward Dolnick, <i>Wall Street   Journal</i>     <P>"[Lewin] documents his thesis in persuasive detail. . . . The reader is carried along by the   power of Mr. Lewin's reporting."--Robert Wright, <i>New York Times Book Review</i>

    - "Introducing a major literary talent, <I>The White Tiger</i> offers a story of coruscating wit, blistering suspense, and questionable morality, told by the most volatile, captivating, and utterly inimitable narrator that this millennium has yet seen.<P>Balram Halwai is a complicated man. Servant. Philosopher. Entrepreneur. Murderer. Over the course of seven nights, by the scattered light of a preposterous chandelier, Balram tells us the terrible and transfixing story of how he came to be a success in life -- having nothing but his own wits to help him along.<P>Born in the dark heart of India, Balram gets a break when he is hired as a driver for his village's wealthiest man, two house Pomeranians (Puddles and Cuddles), and the rich man's (very unlucky) son. From behind the wheel of their Honda City car, Balram's new world is a revelation. While his peers flip through the pages of <I>Murder Weekly</i> (\"Love -- Rape -- Revenge!\"), barter for girls, drink liquor (Thunderbolt), and perpetuate the Great Rooster Coop of Indian society, Balram watches his employers bribe foreign ministers for tax breaks, barter for girls, drink liquor (single-malt whiskey), and play their own role in the Rooster Coop. Balram learns how to siphon gas, deal with corrupt mechanics, and refill and resell Johnnie Walker Black Label bottles (all but one). He also finds a way out of the Coop that no one else inside it can perceive.<P>Balram's eyes penetrate India as few outsiders can: the cockroaches and the call centers; the prostitutes and the worshippers; the ancient and Internet cultures; the water buffalo and, trapped in so many kinds of cages that escape is (almost) impossible, the white tiger. And with a charisma as undeniable as it is unexpected, Balram teaches us that religion doesn't create virtue, and money doesn't solve every problem -- but decency can still be found in a corrupt world, and you can get what you want out of life if you eavesdrop on the right conversations.<P>Sold in sixteen countries around the world, <I>The White Tiger</i> recalls <I>The Death of Vishnu</i> and <I>Bangkok 8</i> in ambition, scope, and narrative genius, with a mischief and personality all its own. Amoral, irreverent, deeply endearing, and utterly contemporary, this novel is an international publishing sensation -- and a startling, provocative debut."

    - Morte D'Urban (New York Review Books Classics)
    - Book
    - J.F. Powers
    - Winner of The 1963 National Book Award for Fiction    <P>The hero of J.F. Powers's comic masterpiece is Father Urban, a man of the cloth who is also a man of the world. Charming, with an expansive vision of the spiritual life and a high tolerance for moral ambiguity, Urban enjoys a national reputation as a speaker on the religious circuit and has big plans for the future. But then the provincial head of his dowdy religious order banishes him to a retreat house in the Minnesota hinterlands. Father Urban soon bounces back, carrying God's word with undaunted enthusiasm through the golf courses, fishing lodges, and backyard barbecues of his new turf. Yet even as he triumphs his tribulations mount, and in the end his greatest success proves a setback from which he cannot recover.  First published in 1962, Morte D'Urban has been praised by writers as various as Gore Vidal, William Gass, Mary Gordon, and Philip Roth. This beautifully observed, often hilarious tale of a most unlikely Knight of Faith is among the finest achievements of an author whose singular vision assures him a permanent place in American literature.

    - Winner of the 1961 National Book Award<br><br>The dazzling novel that established Walker Percy as one of the major voices in Southern<br>literature is now available for the first time in Vintage paperback.<br><br><I>The Moviegoer</I> is Binx Bolling, a young New Orleans stockbroker who surveys the world with<br>the detached gaze of a Bourbon Street dandy even as he yearns for a spiritual redemption he<br>cannot bring himself to believe in. On the eve of his thirtieth birthday, he occupies<br>himself dallying with his secretaries and going to movies, which provide him with the<br>"treasurable moments" absent from his real life. But one fateful Mardi Gras, Binx embarks<br>on a hare-brained quest that outrages his family, endangers his fragile cousin Kate, and<br>sends him reeling through the chaos of New Orleans' French Quarter. Wry and wrenching, rich<br>in irony and romance, The Moviegoer is a genuine American classic.

    - The Waters of Kronos
    - Book
    - Conrad Richter
    - From the time of its first publication in 1960, Conrad Richter's The Waters of Kronos sparked lively debate about the extent to which its story of a belated return to childhood scenes mirrored key events of Richter's own life. As was well known at the time, Richter had spent several years in the Southwest, where he collected the material for his first successful book, Early Americans and Other Stories, but by 1933, he had returned to live in his hometown, Pine Grove, Pennsylvania. John Donner, the main protagonist in The Waters of Kronos, traces a similar route from west to east, although he finds that his family home and native town have been submerged under the deep waters of a lake formed by the construction of a hydroelectric dam. As Richter narrates his alter ego's efforts to salvage his past, he moves beyond "semi-autobiography" to offer what are widely recognized as his most haunting reflections upon the power of family history, the fragility of human memory, and art's role in structuring the communal ethos.  David McCullough, a fellow Pulitzer Prize winner, met and befriended Richter in the 1960s and has called him "an American master," praising The Waters of Kronos as "his most beautiful book." McCullough has contributed a foreword to this edition of The Waters of Kronos, which established Richter as one of the literary giants of the United States.

    - Philip Roth
    - Roth's award-winning first book instantly established its author's reputation as a writer of explosive wit, merciless insight, and a fierce compassion for even the most self-deluding of his characters.<br><br><b>Goodbye, Columbus</b> is the story of Neil Klugman and pretty, spirited Brenda Patimkin, he of poor Newark, she of suburban Short Hills, who meet one summer break and dive into an affair that is as much about social class and suspicion as it is about love. The novella is accompanied by five short stories that range in tone from the iconoclastic to the astonishingly tender and that illuminate the subterranean conflicts between parents and children and friends and neighbors in the American Jewish diaspora.

The stories are set in New York and in Italy (where Malamud's alter ego, the struggleing New York Jewish Painter Arthur Fidelman, roams amid the ruins of old Europe in search of his artistic patrimony); they tell of egg candlers and shoemakers, matchmakers, and rabbis, in a voice that blends vigorous urban realism, Yiddish idiom, and a dash of artistic magic.<br><br><i>The Magic Barrel </i>is a book about New York and about the immigrant experience, and it is high point in the modern American short story. Few books of any kind have managed to depict struggle and frustration and heartbreak with such delight, or such artistry. <br>

    - <p>When <i>The Wapshot Chronicle</i> was published in 1957, John Cheever was already recognized as a writer of superb short stories.  But <i>The Wapshot Chronicle,</i> which won the 1958 National Book Award, established him as a major novelist.</p><p>Based in part on Cheever's adolescence in New England, the novel follows the destinies of the impecunious and wildly eccentric Wapshots of St. Botolphs, a quintessential Massachusetts fishing village.  Here are the stories of Captain Leander Wapshot, venerable sea dog and would-be suicide; of his licentious older son, Moses; and of Moses' adoring and errant younger brother, Coverly. Tragic and funny, ribald and splendidly picaresque, <i>The Wapshot Chronicle</i> is a family narrative in the tradition of Trollope, Dickens, and Henry James.</p>

Through a large body of work --which, unaccountably, has yet to receive the wide attention it deserves--Mr. Morris has adhered to standards which we have come to identify as those of the most serious literary art. His novel The Field of Vision brilliantly climaxes his most richly creative period. It is a work of permanent significance and relevance to those who cannot be content with less than a full effort to cope with the symbolic possibilities of the human condition at the present time."--John W. Aldridge    One of America's most distinguished authors, Wright Morris (1910-1988) wrote thirty-three books.

A first novel by an unknown writer, it remained on the bestseller list for sixteen weeks, won the National Book Award for fiction, and established Ralph Ellison as one of the key writers of the century.  The nameless narrator of the novel describes growing up in a black community in the South, attending a Negro college from which he is expelled, moving to New York and becoming the chief spokesman of the Harlem branch of "the Brotherhood", and retreating amid violence and confusion to the basement lair of the Invisible Man he imagines himself to be.  The book is a passionate and witty tour de force of style, strongly influenced by T.S. Eliot's <B>The Waste Land</B>, Joyce, and Dostoevsky.

    - "<br>In the picturesque Berkshire Hills of Massachusetts, Marit Deym lives alone on a thousand-acre inheritance from her aristocratic Hungarian parents. Though bright and attractive, she is a stranger to the complexities of human relationships. She keeps to herself, venturing out only to defend her one passion: the care of her wild animals--the lynx, bears, fox, and family of wolves for whom she has established a sanctuary on her land.<br><br>Then the wolves bring to her door Gabriel Frankman--a thoughtful young teacher at the nearby school for the blind, lost hiking in the woods. Despite his fear of the wild creatures, Gabriel seems oddly calm in their presence. For Marit, too, there is an immediate, consuming connection to the stranger--the first of her life. But it is a dangerous one. Soon her love of Gabriel will bring forth an unspeakable tragedy: to an innocent life, herself, and her precious animals."

    - Sophie's Choice (Modern Library)
    - Book
    - William Styron
    - "\"[One morning] in the early spring, I woke up with the remembrance of a girl I'd once known, Sophie. It was a very vivid half-dream, half-revelation, and all of a sudden I realized that hers was a story I had to tell.\" That very day, William Styron began writing the first chapter of Sophie's Choice.<br>    First published in 1979, this complex and ambitious novel opens with Stingo, a young southerner, journeying north in 1947 to become a writer. It leads us into his intellectual and emotional entanglement with his neighbors in a Brooklyn rooming house: Nathan, a tortured, brilliant Jew, and his lover, Sophie, a beautiful Polish woman whose wrist bears the grim tattoo of a concentration camp...and whose past is strewn with death that she alone survived.<br>   \"Sophie's Choice is a passionate, courageous book...a philosophical novel on the most important subject of the twentieth century,\" said novelist and critic John Gardner in The New York Times Book Review. \"One of the reasons Styron succeeds so well in Sophie's Choice is that, like Shakespeare (I think the comparison is not too grand), Styron knows how to cut away from the darkness of his material, so that when he turns to it again it strikes with increasing force....Sophie's Choice is a thriller of the highest order, all the more thrilling for the fact that the dark, gloomy secrets we are unearthing one by one--sorting through lies and terrible misunderstandings like a hand groping for a golden nugget in a rattlesnake's nest--may be authentic secrets of history and our own human nature.\"<P>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foun-dation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hard-bound editions of important works of liter-ature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoring as its <br>emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inau-<br>gurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.<P>"

    - "<P>      <P>The World According to Garp is a comic  and compassionate coming-of-age novel that established John Irving as one of the most imaginative writers of his generation. A worldwide bestseller <br>since its publication in 1978, Irving's classic is filled with stories inside stories about the life and times of T. S. Garp, novelist and bastard son of Jenny Fields--a feminist leader ahead of her time. Beyond that, The World According to Garp virtually defies <br>synopsis.<br>----\"Nothing in contemporary fiction matches it,\" said critic Terrence Des Pres. \"Irving's blend of gravity and play is unique, audacious, almost blasphemous. . . . Friendship, marriage and family are his primary themes, but at that blundering level of life where mishap and folly--something close to joyful malice--perpetually intrude and disrupt, often fatally. Life, in Irving's fiction, is always under siege.\" Time magazine commented: \"Irving's popularity is not hard to understand. His world is really the world according to nearly everyone.\"<br>----This Modern Library edition includes a new Introduction by the author.<P>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century.

    - The son of a zookeeper, Pi Patel has an encyclopedic knowledge of animal behavior and a fervent love of stories. When Pi is sixteen, his family emigrates from India to North America aboard a Japanese cargo ship, along with their zoo animals bound for new homes. <br>	<br>The ship sinks. Pi finds himself alone in a lifeboat, his only companions a hyena, an orangutan, a wounded zebra, and Richard Parker, a 450-pound Bengal tiger. Soon the tiger has dispatched all but Pi, whose fear, knowledge, and cunning allow him to coexist with Richard Parker for 227 days while lost at sea. When they finally reach the coast of Mexico, Richard Parker flees to the jungle, never to be seen again. The Japanese authorities who interrogate Pi refuse to believe his story and press him to tell them "the truth." After hours of coercion, Pi tells a second story, a story much less fantastical, much more conventional--but is it more true?<br>

To his pursuers, Kelly is nothing but a monstrous criminal, a thief and a murderer. To his own people, the lowly class of ordinary Australians, the bushranger is a hero, defying the authority of the English to direct their lives. Indentured by his bootlegger mother to a famous horse thief (who was also her lover), Ned saw his first prison cell at 15 and by the age of 26 had become the most wanted man in the wild colony of Victoria, taking over whole towns and defying the law until he was finally captured and hanged. Here is a classic outlaw tale, made alive by the skill of a great novelist.<i><br></i>"

    - Book
    - Margaret Atwood
    - "The Blind Assassin opens with these simple, resonant words: \"Ten days after the war ended, my sister Laura drove a car off a bridge.\" They are spoken by Iris, whose terse account of her sister's death in 1945 is followed by an inquest report proclaiming the death accidental. But just as the reader expects to settle into Laura's story, Atwood introduces a novel-within-a-novel. Entitled The Blind Assassin<i>, </i>it is a science fiction story told by two unnamed lovers who meet in dingy backstreet rooms. When we return to Iris, it is through a 1947 newspaper article announcing the discovery of a sailboat carrying the dead body of her husband, a distinguished industrialist. Brilliantly weaving together such seemingly disparate elements, Atwood creates a world of astonishing vision and unforgettable impact.<br>"

    - Ian McEwan
    - On a chilly February day, two old friends meet in the throng outside a crematorium to pay their last respects to Molly Lane.  Both Clive Linley and Vernon Halliday had been Molly's lovers in the days before they reached their current eminence.  Clive is Britain's most successful modern composer; Vernon is editor of the quality broadsheet <B>The Judge</B>.  Gorgeous, feisty Molly had had other lovers, too, notably Julian Garmony, foreign secretary, a notorious right-winger tipped to be the next prime minister.  <br><br>In the days that follow Molly's funeral, Clive and Vernon will make a pact with consequences neither has foreseen.  Each will make a disastrous moral decision, their friendship will be tested to its limits, and Julian Garmony will be fighting for his political life.  <br><br>In <B>Amsterdam</B>, a contemporary morality tale that is as profound as it is witty, we have Ian McEwan at his wisest and most wickedly disarming.  And why Amsterdam?  What happens there to Clive and Vernon is the most delicious climax of a novel brimming with surprises.<br><br><b>Winner of the 1998 Booker Prize</b>

    - "<strong>Winner of the Booker Prize: \"A work of marvelous vibrance and richness of character.\"--<em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong>  One Sunday morning in Glasgow, shoplifting ex-con Sammy awakens in an alley, wearing another man's shoes and trying to remember his two-day drinking binge. He gets in a scrap with some soldiers and revives in a jail cell, badly beaten and, he slowly discovers, completely blind. And things get worse: his girlfriend disappears, the police question him for a crime they won't name, and his stab at disability compensation embroils him in the Kafkaesque red tape of the welfare bureaucracy. Told in the utterly uncensored language of the Scottish working class, this is a dark and subtly political parable of struggle and survival, rich with irony and black humor. ."

    - The Famished Road
    - Book
    - Ben Okri
    - In the decade since it won the Booker Prize, Ben Okri's Famished Road has become a classic. Like Salman Rushdie's <i>Midnight's Children</i> or Gabriel Garcia Marquez's One Hundred Years of Solitude, it combines brilliant narrative technique with a fresh vision to create an essential work of world literature.<br><br>The narrator, Azaro, is an <i>abiku</i>, a spirit child, who in the Yoruba tradition of Nigeria exists between life and death. The life he foresees for himself and the tale he tells is full of sadness and tragedy, but inexplicably he is born with a smile on his face. Nearly called back to the land of the dead, he is resurrected. But in their efforts to save their child, Azaro's loving parents are made destitute. The tension between the land of the living, with its violence and political struggles, and the temptations of the carefree kingdom of the spirits propels this latter-day Lazarus's story.<br>

For only on that sprawling continent--a haven for misfits of both the animal and human kingdoms--could a nervous Anglican minister who gambles on the instructions of the Divine become allied with a teenaged heiress who buys a glassworks to help liberate her sex. And only the prodigious imagination of Peter Carey could implicate Oscar and Lucinda in a narrative of love and commerce, religion and colonialism, that culminates in a half-mad expedition to transport a glass church across the Outback.

    - The Bone People

    - Keri Hulme
    - "Integrating both Maori myth and New Zealand reality, The Bone People became the most successful novel in New Zealand publishing history when it appeared in 1984.  Set on the South Island beaches of New Zealand, a harsh environment, the novel chronicles the complicated relationships between three emotional outcasts of mixed European and Maori heritage.  Kerewin Holmes is a painter and a loner, convinced that \"to care for anything is to invite disaster.\" Her isolation is disrupted one day when a six-year-old mute boy, Simon, breaks into her house.  The sole survivor of a mysterious shipwreck, Simon has been adopted by a widower Maori factory worker, Joe Gillayley, who is both tender and horribly brutal toward the boy.  Through shifting points of view, the novel reveals each character\xE2\x80\x99s thoughts and feelings as they struggle with the desire to connect and the fear of attachment.     <P>Compared to the works of James Joyce in its use of indigenous language and portrayal of consciousness, The Bone People captures the soul of New Zealand.  After twenty years, it continues to astonish and enrich readers around the world."

    - In the novel that won her the Booker Prize and established her international reputation, Anita Brookner finds a new vocabulary for framing the eternal question "Why love?"  It tells the story of Edith Hope, who writes romance novels under a psudonym.  When her life begins to resemble the plots of her own novels, however, Edith flees to Switzerland, where the quiet luxury of the Hotel du Lac promises to resore her to her senses.<br><br>But instead of peace and rest, Edith finds herself sequestered at the hotel with an assortment  of love's casualties and exiles.  She also attracts the attention of a worldly man determined to release her unused capacity for mischief and pleasure.   Beautifully observed, witheringly funny, <b>Hotel du Lac</b> is Brookner at her most stylish and potently subversive.

    - "Staying On: A Novel (Phoenix Fiction Series)"
    - Book
    - Paul Scott
    - In this sequel to <i>The Raj Quartet</i>, Colonel Tusker and Lucy Smalley stay on in the hills of Pankot after Indian independence deprives them of their colonial status.  Finally fed up with accommodating her husband, Lucy claims a degree of independence herself.  Eloquent and hilarious, she and Tusker act out class tensions among the British of the Raj and give voice to the loneliness, rage, and stubborn affection in their marriage. <i>Staying On</i> won the Booker Prize and was made into a motion picture starring Trevor Howard and Celia Johnson in 1979.    <P>"<i>Staying On</i> far transcends the events of its central action. . . . [The work] should help win for Scott . . . the reputation he deserves--as one of the best novelists to emerge from Britain's silver age."--Robert Towers, <i>Newsweek</i>    <P>"Scott's vision is both precise and painterly. Like an engraver cross-hatching in the illusion of fullness, he selects nuances that will make his characters take on depth and poignancy."--Jean G. Zorn, <i>New York Times Book Review</i>    <P>"A graceful comic coda to the earlier song of India. . . . No one writing knows or can evoke an Anglo-Indian setting better than Scott."--Paul Gray, <i>Time</i>

    - Book
    - Ruth Prawer Jhabvala
    - A profound and powerful novel, winner of the Booker Prize    <P>Set in colonial India during the 1920s, Heat and Dust tells the story of Olivia, a beautiful woman suffocated by the propriety and social constraints of her position as the wife of an important English civil servant. Longing for passion and independence, Olivia is drawn into the spell of the Nawab, a minor Indian prince deeply involved in gang raids and criminal plots. She is intrigued by the Nawab's charm and aggressive courtship, and soon begins to spend most of her days in his company. But then she becomes pregnant, and unsure of the child's paternity, she is faced with a wrenching dilemma. Her reaction to the crisis humiliates her husband and outrages the British community, breeding a scandal that lives in collective memory long after her death.

    - The Siege of Krishnapur (New York Review Books Classics)
    - Book
    - J.G. Farrell
    - A darkly humorous picture of the follies of empire, still as relevant as ever, The Siege of Krishnapur is thought by many to be J. G. Farrell's finest book. Set in India in 1857 (the year of the Great Mutiny, when the Indian sepoys rose in bloody rebellion against their complacent British overlords), Farrell's novel concerns a remote Victorian outpost in the subcontinent. Rumors of strife filter in from afar, but the colonial community remains confident of its superior values, culture, and, of course, military strength - that is, until it is actually under siege. Then gaping cracks begin to open in the veneer of civilization.

    - John Berger
    - "Fascinating...an extraordinary mixture of historical detail and sexual meditation...G. belongs in the tradition of George Eliot, Tolstoy, D. H. Lawrence and Norman Mailer.\" -- The New York Times<P>In this luminous novel -- winner of Britain's prestigious Booker Prize -- John Berger relates the story of \"G.,\" a young man forging an energetic sexual career in Europe during the early years of this century. With profound compassion, Berger explores the hearts and minds of both men and women, and what happens during sex, to reveal the conditions of the Don Juan's success: his essential loneliness, the quiet cumulation in each of his sexual experiences of all of those that precede it, the tenderness that infuses even the briefest of his encounters, and the way women experience their own extraordinariness through their moments with him. All of this Berger sets against the turbulent backdrop of Garibaldi and the failed revolution of Milanese workers in 1898, the Boer War, and the first flight across the Alps, making G. a brilliant novel about the search for intimacy in history's private moments."

    - Book
    - V. S. Naipaul
    - "\"In a Free State\" deals in displacement. It tells first of an Indian servant in Washington, then of an Asian West Indian in London who is in jail for murder. Then the story moves to Africa, to a fictional country something like Uganda or Rwanda. The two main characters are English. They once found Africa liberating, but now it has gone sour on them. At a time of tribal conflict they have to make the long drive to the safety of their compound. In the background, the threat of violence looms. The voices in this novel are breathtakingly vivid, while the characters are portrayed with an intelligence and sensitivity that is rarely seen in contemporary writing. Dennis Potter described the book as one 'of such lucid complexity and such genuine insight, so deft and deep, that it somehow manages to agitate, charm, amuse and excuse the reader all at the same pitch of experience'. This is one of V.S. Naipaul's greatest novels, hard but full of pity."

    - Something to Answer for
    - Book
    - P.H. Newby
    - This book is the winner of the inaugural Booker Prize in 1969. It was 1956 and he was in Port Said. About these two facts Townrow was reasonably certain. He had been summoned there, to Egypt, by the widow of his deceased friend, Elie Khoury. Having been found dead in the street, she is convinced he was murdered, but nobody seems to agree with her. What of Leah Strauss, the mistress? And of the invading British paratroops? Only an Englishman, surely, would take for granted that the British would have behaved themselves. In this weirdly disorientating world, Townrow is forced towards a re-examination of the basic rules by which he has been living his life; and into a realization that he too may have something to answer for.

    - "A marvelous hybrid of mythology and mystery, <b>A Wild Sheep Chase</b><i> </i>is the extraordinary literary thriller that launched Haruki Murakami\xE2\x80\x99s international reputation. <br><br>It begins simply enough: A twenty-something advertising executive receives a postcard from a friend, and casually appropriates the image for an insurance company\xE2\x80\x99s advertisement. What he doesn\xE2\x80\x99t realize is that included in the pastoral scene is a mutant sheep with a star on its back, and in using this photo he has unwittingly captured the attention of a man in black who offers a menacing ultimatum: find the sheep or face dire consequences. Thus begins a surreal and elaborate quest that takes our hero from the urban haunts of Tokyo to the remote and snowy mountains of northern Japan, where he confronts not only the mythological sheep, but the confines of tradition and the demons deep within himself. Quirky and utterly captivating, <b>A Wild Sheep Chase </b>is Murakami at his astounding best."

If the king dies without a male heir, the country could be destroyed by civil war. Henry VIII wants to annul his marriage of twenty years, and marry Anne Boleyn. The pope and most of Europe opposes him. The quest for the king\xE2\x80\x99s freedom destroys his adviser, the brilliant Cardinal Wolsey, and leaves a power vacuum. </P><P>Into this impasse steps Thomas Cromwell. Cromwell is a wholly original man, a charmer and a bully, both idealist and opportunist, astute in reading people and a demon of energy: he is also a consummate politician, hardened by his personal losses, implacable in his ambition. But Henry is volatile: one day tender, one day murderous. Cromwell helps him break the opposition, but what will be the price of his triumph? </P><P>In inimitable style, Hilary Mantel presents a picture of a half-made society on the cusp of change, where individuals fight or embrace their fate with passion and courage. With a vast array of characters, overflowing with incident, the novel re-creates an era when the personal and political are separated by a hairbreadth, where success brings unlimited power but a single failure means death.\xC2\xA0 </P>"

She was warm in every wind and weather, but he was always cold. His hands were as cold as his smile, and almost as cold as his heart. He wore gloves when he was asleep, and he wore gloves when he was awake, which made it difficult for him to pick up pins or coins or the kernels of nuts, or to tear the wings from nightingales.</i><br><br>So begins James Thurber\xE2\x80\x99s sublimely revamped fairy tale, <i>The 13 Clocks</i>, in which a wicked Duke who imagines  he has killed time, and the Duke\xE2\x80\x99s beautiful niece, for whom time seems to have run  out, both meet their match, courtesy of an enterprising and very handsome prince in disguise. Readers young and old will take pleasure in this tale of love forestalled but ultimately fulfilled, admiring its  upstanding hero (\xE2\x80\x9DHe yearned to find in a far land the princess of his dreams, singing as he went, and possibly slaying a dragon here and there\xE2\x80\x9D) and unapologetic villain (\xE2\x80\x9DWe all have flaws,\xE2\x80\x9D the Duke said. \xE2\x80\x9CMine is being wicked\xE2\x80\x9D), while wondering at  the enigmatic Golux, the mysterious stranger whose unpredictable interventions speed the story to its necessarily happy end."

So, in front of his 512 classmates and their 3,000 relatives, he announced: \"I love you, Beth Cooper.\"   <P>It would have been such a sweet, romantic moment. Except that Beth, the head cheerleader, has only the vaguest idea who Denis is. And Denis, the captain of the debate team, is so far out of her league he is barely even the same species. And then there's Kevin, Beth's remarkably large boyfriend, who's in town on furlough from the United States Army. Complications ensue.   "

    - Me Talk Pretty One Day
    - Book
    - David Sedaris
    - A new collection from David Sedaris is cause for jubilation. His recent move to Paris has inspired hilarious pieces, including Me Talk Pretty One Day, about his attempts to learn French. His family is another inspiration. You Cant Kill the Rooster is a portrait of his brother who talks incessant hip-hop slang to his bewildered father. And no one hones a finer fury in response to such modern annoyances as restaurant meals presented in ludicrous towers and cashiers with 6-inch fingernails. Compared by The New Yorker to Twain and Hawthorne, Sedaris has become one of our best-loved authors.

But just before the sultan announces sweeping changes, a wave of murders threatens the fragile balance of power in his court. Who is behind them? Only one intelligence agent can be trusted to find out: Yashim, a man both brilliant and near-invisible in this world, an investigator who can walk with ease in the great halls of the empire, in its streets, and even within its harems--because, of course, Yashim is a eunuch. His investigation points to the Janissaries, who, for four hundred years were the empire's elite soldiers. Crushed by the sultan, could they now be staging a brutal comeback? And can they be stopped without throwing Istanbul into political chaos?<BR>\xC2\xA0<BR>This first book in the Investigator Yashim series is a richly entertaining tale, full of exotic history and intrigue."

    - <center><b><p>The times, they are a-changin' . . .</p></b></center> <p> The Orange County, California, that the Becker brothers knew as boys is no more -- unrecognizably altered since the afternoon in 1954 when Nick, Clay, David, and Andy rumbled with the lowlife Vonns, while five-year-old Janelle Vonn watched from the sidelines. The new decade has brought about the end of the orange groves and the birth of suburban sprawl. It is the era of Johnson, hippies, John Birchers, and LSD. Clay becomes a casualty of a far-off jungle war. Nick becomes a cop, Andy a reporter, David a minister. And the decapitated corpse of teenage beauty queen Janelle Vonn is discovered in an abandoned warehouse. </p> <p> A hideous crime has touched the Beckers in ways that none of them could have anticipated, setting three brothers on a dangerous collision course that will change their family -- and their world -- forever. </p> <p> And no one will emerge from the wreckage unscathed. </p>

    - Silent Joe
    - Book
    - T. Jefferson Parker
    - Scarred for life by a brutal father, Joe Trona found a safe haven and a loving childhood in the home of the couple who adopted him. Now he spends his days as a deputy for the Orange County sheriff's department and his nights as a driver and aide to Will Trona, the influential politician who rescued him from the Hillside Children's Home. An expert in firearms and the martial arts, Joe has been backing Will up for a long time. Still, his skill isn't enough to keep Will alive, and when his father is killed right in front of Joe's eyes, the young deputy vows to avenge him. But first he must find out how the kidnapping of a tycoon's daughter, a scam to line the pockets of Will Trona's political enemies, the murder of two Guatemalan immigrants, the unholy activities of a charismatic minister who's a close friend of the Trona family, and the strange alliance of two rival L.A. gangs are connected to Will's death. Every secret Joe uncovers leads deeper into his beloved father's murky past and ultimately his own. But the reader stays right with this extraordinary man as he battles his demons and ultimately vanquishes them. Author T. Jefferson Parker (The Blue Hour, Red Light, Laguna Heat) is one of the best thriller writers working today. Fans of Michael Connelly and DennisLehane--and Raymond Chandler, for that matter--will appreciate Parker's abilityto create a complex, fascinating, and fully realized hero whose inner reality is brilliantly revealed by his actions. Will Trona is an equally intriguing invention; while ultimately he is an enigma, we remain convinced that he is worthy of his son's devotion. Silent Joe is a mindful, intelligent novel you can't put down. It should break Parker out withthe really big boys of mystery fiction, the million-sellers with the marquee names. In fact, he's a much better writer than most of them, and unlike many, he never tells the same story twice. --Jane Adams

    - The Suspect (Karl Alberg Mysteries, No. 1)
    - Book
    - L.R. Wright
    - To Karl Alberg, a small town on Canada's "Sunshine Coast" looks like the perfect place to sooth a psyche that's been battered by too much big-city police work. Bees buzz among the roses, and the local librarian is attractive, intriguing, and unattached. Perhaps he has at last come in from the cold. But sunny towns can conceal a lot of secrets-some of them bleak enough to make a man yearn for some nice straightforward urban crime. In 1986 The Suspect beat out titles by Ruth Rendell and Jonathan Kellerman to become the first Canadian novel to win an Edgar award. It went on to become a great cult favorite among mystery fans, who prized its delicately etched sense of melancholy, and intriguing character studies of the cop, his quarry, and the enigmatic librarian who proves an unlikely bridge between the two.

But his investigation into a terrible crime is being complicated by an important archaeological dig . . . and a steel hypodermic needle. And the unique laws and sacred religious rites of the Zu\xC3\x91i people are throwing impassable roadblocks in Leaphorn's already twisted path, enabling a craven murderer to elude justice or, worse still, to kill again. <BR></p><BR>"

    - Book
    - Nicholson Baker
    - "<I>The Anthologist</i> is narrated by Paul Chowder -- a once-in-a-while-published kind of poet who is writing the introduction to a new anthology of poetry. He's having a hard time getting started because his career is floundering, his girlfriend Roz has recently left him, and he is thinking about the great poets throughout history who have suffered far worse and deserve to feel sorry for themselves. He has also promised to reveal many wonderful secrets and tips and tricks about poetry, and it looks like the introduction will be a little longer than he'd thought.<P>What unfolds is a wholly entertaining and beguiling love story about poetry: from Tennyson, Swinburne, and Yeats to the moderns (Roethke, Bogan, Merwin) to the staff of <I>The New Yorker</i>, what Paul reveals is astonishing and makes one realize how incredibly important poetry is to our lives. At the same time, Paul barely manages to realize all of this himself, and the result is a tenderly romantic, hilarious, and inspired novel."

    - Kevin Baker
    - <P>At the height of the Civil War, what begins with strong words and a few broken bottles will, over the course of five days, escalate into the worst urban conflagration in American history. Hundreds of thousands of poor Irish immigrants smolder with resentment against a war and a president that have cost them so many of their young men. When word spreads throughout New York's immigrant wards that a military draft is about to be implemented -- a draft from which any rich man's son with $300 can buy an exemption -- trouble begins to spill into the streets.<P>Down in the waterfront slum of Paradise Alley, three women -- Deirdre Dolan O'Kane, Ruth Dove, and Maddy Boyle -- struggle with their private fears as they wait for the storm to descend on them. Deirdre, whose lace-curtain sensibilities have always kept her at arm's length from her neighbors, is devastated by the discovery that her husband, Tom, has been wounded at Gettysburg. In her desperation, Deirdre must turn for aid and comfort to Ruth, a woman she has always judged as morally depraved.<P>Ruth, too, has been cut off from her husband, Billy Dove, an ex-slave. At dawn he set out for the Colored Orphans' Asylum uptown, to collect his last wages. But he has not returned by day's end, or by the next morning. In the meantime, Ruth has learned that dozens of black men and women have been lynched or beaten by rioters.<P>She begins to fear the worst, not just for Billy, but for herself and their children, too -- because she now knows that <I>he</i> is coming. <I>He</i> is Dangerous Johnny Dolan, Deirdre's estranged brother, who after fourteen years' exile has returned to New York. Years before, it was Johnny who saved Ruth from the famine in Ireland, who arranged for her steerage passage from Dublin to New York -- and who beat her mercilessly until she arranged to have him sent away for murder.<P>Even as the riot builds toward its violent climax, Dolan searches relentlessly for Ruth and Deirdre, carried along by the unruly mob. In the end, these remarkable women have nothing but one another to rely on as they seek to protect their homes and families from the brutality of a city -- and a nation -- gone mad. <I>Paradise Alley</i> a story of race and hatred, of love and war, of risk and dauntless courage.

    - "A divorced dad of two teenagers inadvertently combines two incompatible antidepressant medications, goes into a coma, has a stroke, and emerges with brain damage. His teenage son and daughter, Chris and Cathy, inherit some money and decide to rehabilitate their father on their own. The Sleeping Father is about the shift in the way Americans think about mental health \xE2\x80\x94 from regarding personality as being shaped by one\xE2\x80\x99s upbringing to its being shaped by the bloodstream\xE2\x80\x99s hormone levels. In focusing on one family in crisis, Sharpe addresses the larger crisis in faith and authority in contemporary American life. Ultimately, this is a weird but wonderful story about two children who, not having an adequate father, decide to make one."

    - <p>At the height of the Civil War, word spreads through the poorest quarters of New York City that a military draft is about to be implemented -- a draft from which any rich man's son can buy an exemption.  The outrage this inspires escalates into the worst urban conflagration in American history.  </p><p>Down in the waterfront slum of Paradise Alley, three women -- Deirdre Dolan O'Kane, Ruth Dove, and Maddy Boyle -- struggle with their private fears as they wait for the storm to descend upon them.  Deirdre, devastated by the news that her husband, Tom, has been wounded in Gettysburg, must turn for comfort and aid to two women she has always judged as morally depraved -- Ruth, married to an ex-slave, and Maddy, a hard-living prostitute.  </p>

Struggling to find a voice above the boom of her brothers and to understand her place on this side of the border and that, Lala is a shrewd observer of family life.  But when she starts telling the Awful Grandmother's life story, seeking clues to how she got to be so awful, grandmother accuses Lala of exaggerating. Soon, a multigenerational family narrative turns into a whirlwind exploration of storytelling, lies, and life. Like the cherished <i>rebozo</i>, or shawl, that has been passed down through generations of Reyes women,<b> Caramelo</b> is alive with the vibrations of history, family, and love.

Who took the photograph? Where was it taken? When? Had Kath planned for him to find out all along? As Glyn begins to search for answers, he, and those around him, find the certainties of the past and present slip away, and the picture of the beautiful woman they all thought they knew distort.

    - Walden
    - Book
    - Michael T. Dolan
    - "Written by Michael T. Dolan, WALDEN deconstructs higher education, the struggle for individualism, and the parade of conformity in one fell swoop of a very sharp pen. In the tradition of the great angry young men novels, WALDEN presents a humorous, shocking and thoroughly modern take on a young man's struggle for self. Tucked into one day, you ll find the grand themes of love and death, revolution and freedom, hope and enlightenment. And you ll find the Who and the Stones, back before they were doing Hummer commercials, CSI theme songs, and Microsoft jingles. Pick up a copy today, and join the revolution that is WALDEN.      Says author Iain Levison, author of A Working Stiff's Manifesto: WALDEN is a story about the seamier side of campus life, a life far removed from the smiling faces on the college brochures. Mike Dolan has crafted a powerful and evocative story, full of anger, frustration and misdirected emotion, about a young man caught up in the anonymous and soul-crushing world of the educational system. Should be required reading for all college freshmen."

    - "The publication of \xE2\x80\x9CNotes to My Biographer,\xE2\x80\x9D in <i>Zoetrope: All-Story </i>magazine introduced readers to the remarkable voice of Adam Haslett.  Nominated as part of a National Magazine Award, broadcast on National Public Radio, performed at venues across the country, the story brought the author widespread recognition.<br><br>Now, in his first book, Adam Haslett gives us nine richly varied stories, each suffused with intense emotion and written in a lyric prose alternatively lush and spare.  <i>You Are Not a Stranger Here</i> carries its readers into the hearts and minds of people facing life\xE2\x80\x99s most profound dilemmas.  We meet an aging inventor still burning with ideas as he makes a final visit to his gay son.  A psychiatrist\xE2\x80\x99s encounter with a reluctant patient reveals a young doctor\xE2\x80\x99s own needs and fears.  An orphaned boy finds solace in a classmate\xE2\x80\x99s violence.  The return of an old lover disturbs the peace between a brother and sister who have lived together for decades.<br><br>In settings that range from New England to Great Britain, from Los Angeles to the American West, the stories in this book treat what Faulkner called the old verities and truths of the heart: love and honor, pity and pride, compassion and sacrifice.  They do so with heartbreaking precision and an often generous humor, drawing us past the surface of characters\xE2\x80\x99 lives into the moments of decision and recognition that shape them irrevocably.   Together these stories constitute a significant achievement by a powerful new writer."

    - I watch sixteen football games over nine hours. It's an extraordinary accomplishment...With the remote secure in the palm of my hand, or more often resting on my chest, I am all powerful. I haven't missed an important play since the Carter administration. His streak of murder case acquittals made him a regular on cable talk shows. His recent $22 million inheritance bought him a dog rescue operation named after his beloved golden retriever. Now after turning down cases left and right, attorney Andy Carpenter feels like he's facing a midlife crisis. And just when he decides he needs some real work, a newspaper owner friend asks Andy to protect his star reporter. Daniel Cummings is being used as a mouthpiece by a serial killer...but the reporter gets way too close to his story when he's found near the murderer's latest victim. Quickly working to save what's left of Cummings's rep, Andy soon makes news himself when he starts receiving death threats-and moves dangerously close to becoming tomorrow's big obituary.

He is a quiet man, a husband and father, a hardworking barber, a kindly landlord to the men who live in a basement apartment in his home. He is a fixture in his Brooklyn neighborhood, recognizable by the terrifying scar on his face. As the book unfolds, moving seamlessly between Haiti in the 1960s and New York City today, we enter the lives of those around him: his devoted wife and rebellious daughter; his sometimes unsuspecting, sometimes apprehensive neighbors, tenants, and clients. And we meet some of his victims.In the book\xE2\x80\x99s powerful denouement, we return to the Haiti of the dew breaker\xE2\x80\x99s past, to his last, desperate act of violence, and to his first encounter with the woman who will offer him a form of redemption\xE2\x80\x94albeit imperfect\xE2\x80\x94that will change him forever.<i>The Dew Breaker</i> is a book of interconnected lives\xE2\x80\x94a book of love, remorse, and hope; of rebellions both personal and political; of the compromises we often make in order to move beyond the most intimate brushes with history. Unforgettable, deeply resonant, <i>The Dew Breaker </i>proves once more that in Edwidge Danticat we have a major American writer."

    - "Set in Eisenhower-era Chicago, An Unfinished Season brilliantly evokes a city, an epoch, and a shift in ideals through the closely observed story of nineteen-year-old Wilson Ravan. In his summer before college, Wils finds himself straddling three worlds: the working-class newsroom where he's landed a coveted job as a rookie reporter, the whirl of glittering North Shore debutante parties where he spends his nights, and the growing cold war between his parents at home. With unparalleled grace, Ward Just brings Wils's circle to radiant life. Through his finely wrought portraits of a father and son, young lovers, and newsroom dramas, Just also stirringly depicts an American poltical era."

    - Book
    - Marianne Wiggins
    - This poetic novel, by the acclaimed author of John Dollar, describes America at the brink of the Atomic Age. In the years between the two world wars, the future held more promise than peril, but there was evidence of things unseen that would transfigure our unquestioned trust in a safe future.<P>Fos has returned to Tennessee from the trenches of France. Intrigued with electricity, bioluminescence, and especially x-rays, he believes in science and the future of technology. On a trip to the Outer Banks to study the Perseid meteor shower, he falls in love with Opal, whose father is a glassblower who can spin color out of light.<P>Fos brings his new wife back to Knoxville where he runs a photography studio with his former Army buddy Flash. A witty rogue and a staunch disbeliever in Prohibition, Flash brings tragedy to the couple when his appetite for pleasure runs up against both the law and the Ku Klux Klan. Fos and Opal are forced to move to Opal's mother's farm on the Clinch River, and soon they have a son, Lightfoot. But when the New Deal claims their farm for the TVA, Fos seeks work at the Oak Ridge Laboratory -- Site X in the government's race to build the bomb.<P>And it is there, when Opal falls ill with radiation poisoning, that Fos's great faith in science deserts him. Their lives have traveled with touching inevitability from their innocence and fascination with "things that glow" to the new world of manmade suns.<P>Hypnotic and powerful, <I>Evidence of Things Unseen</I> constructs a heartbreaking arc through twentieth-century American life and belief.

    - Book
    - Robert Stone
    - The stories collected in Bear and His Daughter span nearly thirty years - 1969 to the present - and they explore, acutely and powerfully, the humanity that unites us. In "Miserere," a widowed librarian with an unspeakable secret undertakes an unusual and grisly role in the anti-abortion crusade. "Under the Pitons" is the harrowing story of a reluctant participant in a drug-running scheme and the grim and unexpected consequences of his involvement. The title story is a riveting account of the tangled lines that weave together the relationship of a father and his grown daughter.

    - "Unlocking the Air: Stories"
    - Book
    - Ursula K. Le Guin
    - Ursula Le Guin, the much-honored author of 16 novels, 80 short stories, 10 books for children, several volumes of poetry, and numerous screenplays once again demonstrates her virtuosity and versatility in this superb collection of short stories. Written over a span of 12 years, and previously published in such prestigious publications as <I>The New Yorker, Harpers, Omni, </I>and<I> Playboy,</I> these stories are connected in the way they approach reality while diffusing the traditional boundaries of realism, magical realism, and surrealism. In each, Le Guin finds the detail that reveals the strange in everyday life, or the unexpected depths of an ordinary person. Written with wit, zest, and a passionate sense of human frailty and toughness, <I>Unlocking the Air and Other Stories</I> is superb fiction by a beloved storyteller at the height of her power.

    - Book
    - Joanna Scott

Dubbed the Henry Ford of Natural History, by 1917 Craxton has become Americas preeminent taxidermist. Into this magic box of a worldfilled with eerily inanimate gibbons and bats, owls and peacocks, quetzals and crocodileswanders young Peg Griswood, daughter of Craxtons newest housekeeper.

    - Mr. Ives' Christmas
    - Book
    - Oscar Hijuelos
    - Hijuelos' novel tells the story of Mr. Ives, who was adopted from a foundling's home as a child. When we first meet him in the 1950s, Mr. Ives is very much a product of his time. He has a successful career in advertising, a wife and two children, and believes he is on his way to pursuing the typical American dream. But the dream is shattered when his son Robert, who is studying for the priesthood, is killed violently at Christmas. Overwhelmed by grief and threatened by a loss of faith in humankind, Mr. Ives begins to question the very foundations of his life. Part love story--of a man for his wife, for his children, for God--and part meditation on how a person can find spiritual peace in the midst of crisis, <i>Mr. Ives' Christmas </i>is a beautifully written, tender and passionate story of a man trying to put his life in perspective. In the expert hands of Oscar Hijuelos, the novel speaks eloquently to the most basic and fulfilling aspects of life for all of us.

    - The Collected Stories of Reynolds Price
    - Book
    - Reynolds Price
    - <P> For more than four decades, Reynolds Price has been one of America's most distinguished writers, with a career remarkable both for its virtuosity and for the variety of literary forms embraced. Though perhaps best known as a novelist and poet, Price here likewise demonstrates his mastery of the short story. <P> These fifty stories include two early collections -- <I>The Names and Faces of Heroes</I> and <I>Permanent Errors</I> -- as well as more than two dozen stories that are gathered only in <I>The Collected Stories.</I> In his introduction, the author explains how, at one point, he wrote no stories for almost twenty years. "But," he writes, "once I needed -- for unknown reasons in a new and radically altered life -- to return to the story, it opened before me like a new chance." Indeed, chances abound here in stories that will astonish even Price's most devoted readers as they travel through not only the author's native North Carolina but also Jerusalem, the American Southwest, Europe, and Asia.

But she was murdered by the greed of white men, and the Graycloud family, who cared for her daughter, began dying mysteriously. Letters sent to Washington, D.C. begging for help  went unanswered, until at last a Native American government official, Stace Red Hawk, traveled west to investigate.

    - On March 2, 1908, nineteen-year-old Lazarus Averbuch, an Eastern European Jewish immigrant, was shot to death on the doorstep of the Chicago chief of police and cast as a would-be anarchist assassin.<BR><BR> A century later, a young Eastern European writer in Chicago named Brik becomes obsessed with Lazarus's story. Brik enlists his friend Rora-a war photographer from Sarajevo-to join him in retracing Averbuch's path.<BR><BR> Through a history of pogroms and poverty, and a prism of a present-day landscape of cheap mafiosi and even cheaper prostitutes, the stories of Averbuch and Brik become inextricably intertwined, creating a truly original, provocative, and entertaining novel that confirms Aleksandar Hemon as one of the most dynamic and essential literary voices of our time.

    - "Rachel Kushner has written an astonishingly wise, ambitious, and riveting novel set in the American community in Cuba during the years leading up to Castro's revolution -- a place that was a paradise for a time and for a few. The first novel to tell the story of the Americans who were driven out in 1958, this is a masterful debut.<P>Young Everly Lederer and K. C. Stites come of age in Oriente Province, where the Americans tend their own fiefdom -- three hundred thousand acres of United Fruit Company sugarcane that surround their gated enclave. If the rural tropics are a child's dreamworld, Everly and K.C. nevertheless have keen eyes for the indulgences and betrayals of the grown-ups around them -- the mordant drinking and illicit loves, the race hierarchies and violence.<P>In Havana, a thousand kilometers and a world away from the American colony, a cabaret dancer meets a French agitator named Christian de La Mazi\xC3\xA8re, whose seductive demeanor can't mask his shameful past. Together they become enmeshed in the brewing political underground. When Fidel and Ra\xC3\xBAl Castro lead a revolt from the mountains above the cane plantation, torching the sugar and kidnapping a boat full of \"yanqui\" revelers, K.C. and Everly begin to discover the brutality that keeps the colony humming. Though their parents remain blissfully untouched by the forces of history, the children hear the whispers of what is to come.<P>At the time, urgent news was conveyed by telex. Kushner's first novel is a tour de force, haunting and compelling, with the urgency of a telex from a forgotten time and place."

    - Salvatore Scibona
    - <B>An incredible debut and National Book Award-nominated novel-it's "<I>Memento</I> meets <I>Augie March</I>. Didion meets Hitchcock" (<I>Esquire</I>).</B><BR><BR> It is August 15, 1953, the day of a boisterous and unwieldy street carnival in Elephant Park, an Italian immigrant enclave in northern Ohio. As the festivities reach a riotous pitch and billow into the streets, five members of the community labor under the weight of a terrible secret. As these floundering souls collide, one day of calamity and consequence sheds light on a half century of their struggles, their follies, and their pride. And slowly, it becomes clear that buried deep in the hearts of these five exquisitely drawn characters is the long-silenced truth about the crime that twisted each of their worlds.<BR><BR> Cast against the racial, spiritual, and moral tension that has given rise to modern America, this first novel exhumes the secrets lurking in the darkened crevices of the soul of our country. Inventive, explosive, and revelatory, <I>The End</I> introduces Salvatore Scibona as an important new voice in American fiction.

Her subjects include the five senses, fourth-graders, good taste, and tropical storms. She offers a reinterpretation of insomnia and re-creates the ordeals of Kafka in the kitchen. She questions the lengths to which one should go to save the life of a caterpillar, proposes a clear account of the sexual act, rides the bus, probes the limits of marital fidelity, and unlocks the secret to a long and happy life.<BR><BR>No two of these fictions are alike.

As the smoke slowly clears, Remy finds that his memory is skipping, lurching between moments of lucidity and days when he doesn't seem to be living his own life at all. The landscape around him is at once fractured and oddly familiar: a world dominated by a Machiavellian mayor known as \"The Boss,\" and peopled by gawking celebrities, anguished policemen peddling First Responder cereal, and pink real estate divas hyping the spoils of tragedy. Remy himself has a new girlfriend he doesn't know, a son who pretends he's dead, and an unsettling new job chasing a trail of paper scraps for a shadowy intelligence agency known as the Department of Documentation. Whether that trail will lead Remy to an elusive terror cell\xE2\x80\x94or send him circling back to himself\xE2\x80\x94is only one of the questions posed by this provocative yet deeply human novel. </p> <p> From a novelist of astounding talent, <i>The Zero</i> is an extraordinary story of how our trials become our transgressions, of how we forgive ourselves and whether or not we should. </p>"

    - Book
    - Rene Steinke
    - <p>No one in 1917 New York had ever encountered a woman like the Bar-oness Elsa von Freytag-Loringhoven -- poet, artist, proto-punk rocker, sexual libertine, fashion avatar, and unrepentant troublemaker. When she wasn't stalking the streets of Greenwich Village wearing a brassiere made from tomato cans, she was enthusiastically declaiming her poems to sailors in beer halls or posing nude for Man Ray or Marcel Duchamp. In an era of brutal war, technological innovation, and cataclysmic change, the Baroness had resolved to create her own destiny -- taking the center of the Dadaist circle, breaking every bond of female propriety . . . and transforming herself into a living, breathing work of art.</p>

    - Christine Schutt
    - In this elegiac and luminous novel, which John Ashbery called "an amazing achievement" and Mary Gordon dubbed "a wholly original endeavor," Christine Schutt gives voice to the feast of memory, the mystery of the mad and missing, and the power of words. <br><br>Set in the Midwest, where Florida represents a faraway paradise, this novel tells the story of Alice Fivey. Fatherless since she was seven, Alice is left in the care of her relatives at the age of ten, when her mother, whose "toenails winked in the foil bed we knew for Florida," is institutionalized. Alice is moved from place to place, remaining still while others try to mold her into someone different from her mother. She consoles herself with books and becomes a storyteller herself as she moves into adulthood, ever further from the desolation of her mother's actions and closer to the meaning of her own experience. <br><br>Told in brief scenes of spare beauty, Florida is a graceful and gripping tale of family, forgiveness, and creation of the self. <br><br>

    - Kate Walbert
    - "<P> From the award-winning author of <I>The Gardens of Kyoto</I> comes this witty and incisive novel about the lives and attitudes of a group of women -- once country-club housewives; today divorced, independent, and breaking the rules. <P> In <I>Our Kind,</I> Kate Walbert masterfully conveys the dreams and reality of a group of women who came into the quick rush of adulthood, marriage, and child-bearing during the 1950s. Narrating from the heart of ten companions, Walbert subtly depicts all the anger, disappointment, vulnerability, and pride of her characters: \"Years ago we were led down the primrose lane, then abandoned somewhere near the carp pond.\" <P> Now alone, with their own daughters grown, they are finally free -- and ready to take charge: from staging an intervention for the town deity to protesting the slaughter of the country club's fairway geese, to dialing former lovers in the dead of night. <P> Walbert's writing is quick-witted and wry, just like her characters, but also, in its cumulative effect, moving and sad. <I>Our Kind</I> is a brilliant, thought-provoking novel that opens a window into the world of a generation and class of women caught in a cultural limbo."

    - Acclaimed by critics, Martha McPhee's debut Bright Angel Time established her as a dazzling new talent in American fiction; she fulfills her promise and breaks ambitious new ground with Gorgeous Lies. Charismatic therapist Anton Furey is dying, and the tribe he heads-his five children, his wife's three, and their uniting child, Alice-has returned to Chardin, the farm where they grew up and played out Anton's vision of communal living. They had been famous for being the new American blended family, their utopian lifestyle chronicled by film crews and reporters. But as Anton grows weaker, the hurts and betrayals of those years boil to the surface, and the children find themselves reliving the knotty intimacies they share as they struggle to make their peace with Anton. With shimmering prose and an acutely observant eye, McPhee has created a portrait of an era and a family that explores the limits, and obligations, of love.<br>

    - "<B>Shortlisted for the 2002 National Book Award in Fiction</B>: a dark, riotous Southern novel of sex, death, and transformation.     <P>Brad Watson's first novel has been eagerly awaited since his breathtaking, award-winning debut collection of short stories, <I>Last Days of the Dog-Men</I>. Here, he fulfills that literary promise with a humorous and jaundiced eye. Finus Bates has loved Birdie Wells since the day he saw her do a naked cartwheel in the woods in 1916. Later he won her at poker, lost her, then nearly won her again after the mysterious poisoning of her womanizing husband. Does Vish, the old medicine woman down in the ravine, hold the key to Birdie's elusive character? Or does Parnell, the town undertaker, whose unspeakable desires bring lust for life and death together? Or does the secret lie with some other colorful old-timer in Mercury, Mississippi, not such a small town anymore? With \"graceful, patient, insightful and hilarious\" prose (<I>USA Today</I>), Brad Watson chronicles Finus's steadfast devotion and Mercury's evolution from a sleepy backwater to a small city. With this \"tragicomic story of missed opportunities and unjust necessities\" (Fred Chappell), \"Southern storytelling is alive and well in Watson's capable hands\" (<I>Kirkus Reviews</I> starred review). \"His work may remind readers of William Faulkner, Toni Morrison, or Flannery O'Connor, but has a power\xE2\x80\x94and a charm\xE2\x80\x94all its own, more pellucid than the first, gentler than the second, and kinder than the third\" (<I>Baltimore Sun</I>).    <P>A potent cocktail of Southern gothic and classical mythology, this is a novel only Brad Watson could have written\xE2\x80\x94an unforgettable portrait of the most romantic aspirations and most twisted inclinations of the bleak and lovely human heart.

    - "In the summer of '76, the Shulmans and the Melishes migrate to Kaaterskill, the tiny town in upstate New York where Orthodox Jews and Yankee year-rounders live side by side from June through August. Elizabeth Shulman, a devout follower of Rav Elijah Kirshner and the mother of five daughters, is restless. She needs a project of her own, outside her family and her cloistered community. Across the street, Andras Melish is drawn to Kaaterskill by his adoring older sisters, bound to him by their loss and wrenching escape from the Holocaust. Both comforted and crippled by his sisters' love, Andras cannot overcome the ambivalence he feels toward his children and his own beautiful wife. At the top of the hill, Rav Kirshner is coming to the end of his life, and he struggles to decide which of his sons should succeed him: the pious but stolid Isaiah, or the brilliant but worldly Jeremy. Behind the scenes, alarmed as his beloved Kaaterskill is overdeveloped by Michael King, the local real estate broker, Judge Miles Taylor keeps an old secret in check, biding his time...."

    - Damascus Gate
    - Book
    - Robert Stone
    - With soaring vision and profound intelligence, Robert Stone has written a harrowing, breathtaking novel about our desperate search, at any price, for the consolation of redemption - and about the people who are all too willing to provide it. A violent confrontation in the Gaza Strip, a mind-altering pilgrimage, a race through riot-filled Jerusalem streets, a cat-and-mouse game in an underground maze, a desperate attempt to prevent a bomb from detonating beneath the Temple Mount - Damascus Gate is an exhilarating journey through the moral and religious ambiguities that haunt the holiest of cities and its seekers, cynics, hustlers, and madmen. Set in Jerusalem, where violence, ecstasy, heresy, and salvation are all to be found, Damascus Gate is simultaneously the story of a man's search for truth - or some version of it - and the story of a city where sanity is casually traded for faith.

    - Here is Just's masterpiece - an epic chronicle of three generations of Washington power brokers and the womenfolk who loved them (except when they didn't). The Washington Post described this book as "a fascinating if ultimately painful fairy tale, complete with a family curse. The decline of the Behls represents the decline of Washington from the bright dawn of the American century into the gathering shadows of an alien new millennium."

    - "The Puttermesser Papers: A Novel"
    - Book
    - Cynthia Ozick
    - With dashing originality and in prose that sings like an entire choir of sirens, Cynthia Ozick relates the life and times of her most compelling fictional creation. Ruth Puttermesser lives in New York City. Her learning is monumental. Her love life is minimal (she prefers pouring through Plato to romping with married Morris Rappoport). And her fantasies have a disconcerting tendency to come true - with disastrous consequences for what we laughably call "reality."<P>Puttermesser yearns for a daughter and promptly creates one, unassisted, in the form of the first recorded female golem. Laboring in the dusty crevices of the civil service, she dreams of reforming the city - and manages to get herself elected mayor. Puttermesser contemplates the afterlife and is hurtled into it headlong, only to discover that a paradise found is also paradise lost. Overflowing with ideas, lambent with wit, <i>The Puttermesser Papers</i> is a tour de force by one of our most visionary novelists. <P>"The finest achievement of Ozick's career... It has all the buoyant integrity of a Chagall painting." -<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i><br>"Fanciful, poignant... so intelligent, so finely expressed that, like its main character, it remains endearing, edifying, a spark of light in the gloom." -<i>The New York Times</i><br>"A crazy delight." -<i>The New York Time Book Review</i>

    - Madison Smartt Bell
    - "In this first installment of his epic Haitian trilogy, Madison Smartt Bell brings to life a decisive moment in the history of race, class, and colonialism. The slave uprising in Haiti was a momentous contribution to the tide of revolution that swept over the Western world at the end of the 1700s. A brutal rebellion that strove to overturn a vicious system of slavery, the uprising successfully transformed Haiti from a European colony to the world\xE2\x80\x99s first Black republic.  From the center of this horrific maelstrom, the heroic figure of Toussaint Louverture\xE2\x80\x93a loyal, literate slave and\xC2\xA0both a devout Catholic and Vodouisant\xE2\x80\x93emerges as the man who will take the merciless fires of violence and vengeance and forge a revolutionary war fueled by\xC2\xA0liberty and equality. <br><br>Bell assembles a kaleidoscopic portrait of this seminal movement through a tableau of characters that encompass black, white, male, female, rich, poor, free and enslaved.  Pulsing with brilliant detail, <b>All Soul\xE2\x80\x99s Rising</b> provides a visceral sense of the pain, terror, confusion, and triumph of revolution."

    - Edwidge Danticat
    - When Haitians tell a story, they say "Krik?" and the eager listeners answer "Krak!" In <b>Krik? Krak!</b> In her second novel, Edwidge Danticat establishes herself as the latest heir to that narrative tradition with nine stories that encompass both the cruelties and the high ideals of Haitian life. They tell of women who continue loving behind prison walls and in the face of unfathomable loss; of a people who resist the brutality of their rulers through the powers of imagination. The result is a collection that outrages, saddens, and transports the reader with its sheer beauty.<br>

    - Cristina Garcia
    - "\"Remarkable...An intricate weaving of dramatic events with the supernatural and the cosmic...Evocative and lush...A rich and haunting narrative, an excellent new voice in contemporary fiction.\"<br>SAN FRANCISCO CHRONICLE<br>Now available in a Spanish language edition from Ballantine Books.<br>Here is the dreamy and bittersweet story of a family divided by politics and geography by the Cuban revolution. It is the family story of Celia del Pino, and her husband, daughter and grandchildren, from the mid-1930s to 1980. Celia's story mirrors the magical realism of Cuba itself, a country of beauty and poverty, idealism and corruption. DREAMING IN CUBAN presents a unique vision and a haunting lamentation for a past that might have been. <br>"

    - Lost in the City
    - Book
    - Edward P. Jones
    - <p>The nation's capital that serves as the setting for the stories in Edward P. Jones's prizewinning collection, <em>Lost in the City</em>, lies far from the city of historic monuments and national politicians. Jones takes the reader beyond that world into the lives of African American men and women who work against the constant threat of loss to maintain a sense of hope. From "The Girl Who Raised Pigeons" to the well-to-do career woman awakened in the night by a phone call that will take her on a journey back to the past, the characters in these stories forge bonds of community as they struggle against the limits of their city to stave off the loss of family, friends, memories, and, ultimately, themselves.</p> <p>Critically acclaimed upon publication, <em>Lost in the City</em> introduced Jones as an undeniable talent, a writer whose unaffected style is not only evocative and forceful but also filled with insight and poignancy.</p>

    - Outerbridge Reach
    - Book
    - Robert Stone
    - In this towering story about a man pitting himself against the sea, against society, and against himself, Robert Stone again demonstrates that he is "one of the most impressive novelists of his generation" (New York Review of Books). Inviting comparison with the great sea novels of Conrad, Melville, and Hemingway, Outerbridge Reach is also the portrait of two men and the powerful, unforgettable woman they both love - and for whom they are both ready, in their very different ways, to stake everything. As the San Francisco Chronicle said, "Robert Stone asks questions of our time few writers could imagine and answers them in narratives few readers will ever quite forget."

    - The MacGuffin
    - Book
    - Stanley Elkin
    - In The MacGuffin, Elkin narrates with accustomed panache the mysterious events that take place in something under forty hours in the life of Bobby Druff, City Commissioner of Streets, aged fifty-eight, whose ordered world of avenues and roads seems suddenly a rather more complicated maze than he remembers. Events, in fact, conspire against him, and his wife, his son, his new-found lover, even his chauffeur, appear to be in on it. The novel combines a sort of tough-talking, laugh-out-loud humor and that odd, amusing, under-the-breath revenge of the powerless with the twists and killer thrill rides of a plot to rival Hitchcock's.

    - Felipe Alfau
    - "Novel. Written in the 1940s but left unpublished until 1990, this is Alfau's hilarious and innovative epic of American immigration. Its opening line is: \"The moment one learns English, complications set in.\" It is exactly these \"complications\" to which we are treated over the course of this novel, which is at once darkly humorous and strangely apocalyptic. \"Alfau has created a poetic, cinematic and glittering black comedy which works on many levels. His timeless creations take the longer view of history, and attempt to decide: 'whether my ancestors were but immigrants disguised as conquerors, or whether all aliens are but conquerors disguised as immigrants'\"-Dublin Sunday Tribune. Felipe Alfau was born in 1902 in Barcelona. He immigrated to the United States during World War I, where he studied music and wrote music criticism. His only other novel, LOCOS, was published in 1936."

    - The Hundred Secret Senses
    - Book
    - Amy Tan
    - <b>The Hundred Secret Senses</b> is an exultant novel about China and America, love and loyalty, the identities we invent and the true selves we discover along the way. Olivia Laguni is half-Chinese, but typically American in her uneasiness with her patchwork family. And no one in Olivia's family is more embarrassing to her than her half-sister, Kwan Li. For Kwan speaks mangled English, is cheerfully deaf to Olivia's sarcasm, and sees the dead with her "yin eyes."<P>Even as Olivia details the particulars of her decades-long grudge against her sister (who, among other things, is a source of infuriatingly good advice), Kwan Li is telling her own story, one that sweeps us into the splendor, squalor, and violence of Manchu China. And out of the friction between her narrators, Amy Tan creates a work that illuminates both the present and the past sweetly, sadly, hilariously, with searing and vivid prose.<P>"Truly magical...unforgettable...this novel...shimmer[s] with meaning."--San Diego Tribune<P>"<b>The Hundred Secret Senses</b> doesn't simply return to a world but burrows more deeply into it, following new trails to fresh revelations."--Newsweek

With this electrifying backdrop, Anne Michaels propels us into her rapturously acclaimed novel of loss, memory, history, and redemption.

    - "Pauline Melville conjures up vivid pictures both of savanna and forest and of city life in South America where love is often trumped by disaster.  Unforgettable characters illuminate theme and plot: Sonny, the strange, beautiful and isolate son of Beatrice and Danny, the brother and sister who have a passionate affair at the time of the solar eclipse in 1919; Father Napier, the sandy-haired evangelist whom the Indians perceive as a giant grasshopper; Chofy McKinnon the modern Indian, torn between savanna life and urban future.  This is a novel that embraces nearly a century, large in scope but intimate as a whisper, where laughter is never far from the scene of tragedy; a parable of miscegenation and racial elusiveness, of nature defying culture, magic confronting rationalism and of the eternally rebellious nature of love.<br>"

    - Lives of the Monster Dogs
    - Book
    - Kirsten Bakis
    - A postmodern Mary Shelley, taking the parable of Frankenstein's monster several giant steps farther, might have written this fable of a novel about a tragic race of monster dogs--in this case, genetically and biomechanically engineered dogs (of several major breeds). Created by a German mad scientist in the 19th century, the monster dogs possess human intelligence, speak human language, have prosthetic humanlike hands and walk upright on hind legs. The dogs' descendants arrive in New York City in the year 2008, still acting like Victorian-era aristocrats. Most important, the monster dogs suffer humanlike frailties and, ultimately, real suffering more serious and affecting than the subject matter might at first glance suggest.

    - Larry's Party
    - Book
    - Carol Shields
    - "The San Diego Tribune called The Stone Diaries a \"universal study of what makes women tick.\" With Larry's Party Carol Shields has done the same for men. Larry Weller, born in 1950, is an ordinary guy made extraordinary by his creator's perception, irony, and tenderness. Larry's Party gives us, as it were, a CAT scan of his life, in episodes between 1977 and 1997, that seamlessly flash backward and forward. We follow this young floral designer through two marriages and divorces, and his interactions with his parents, friends, and a son. Throughout, we witness his deepening passion for garden mazes--so like life, with their teasing treachery and promise of reward. Among all the paradoxes and accidents of his existence, Larry moves through the spontaneity of the seventies, the blind enchantment of the eighties, and the lean, mean nineties, completing at last his quiet, stubborn search for self. Larry's odyssey mirrors the male condition at the end of our century with targeted wit, unerring poignancy, and faultless wisdom.  "

    - Book
    - Marilyn Bowering
    - In Visible Worlds, award-winning Canadian poet and playwright Marilyn Bowering has created a beguiling, multilayered novel that brings together two seemingly disparate stories as it traces the shattering personal consequences of war.<P>Visible Worlds begins in 1960, with the death of Nate Bone on a Winnipeg football field, as his family and friends stand by and watch. The story then shifts to the tundra of Siberia, where, at the same time, a young woman identified only as Fika is trying to make her way from the Soviet Union to freedom. As the novel unfolds, these two seemingly unrelated events--literally worlds apart--become key pieces in Bowering's astonishing fictional puzzle.<P>That puzzle is assembled by Albrecht Storr, one of twin sons of German immigrants, who becomes the primary narrator of the novel. Looking back to 1935, when he, his brother Gerhard, and Nate were children together, Albrecht slowly recounts a chain of extraordinary events set off when Nate, still suffering from the death of his sister, kidnaps an infant girl. That reckless, long undetected act leaves few lives unaffected, and will lead, a quarter of a century later, to Fika's remarkable journey across the spare, life-threatening, yet inconceivably beautiful frozen landscape.<BR>

    - Julia Blackburn
    - In this fascinatingly imaginative novel, Julia Blackburn has decimated all the rules, creating a magical tale that is part fable, part allegory, part present, part past, and wholly genuine and poetic. <br><br>The unnamed protagonist has recently lost someone she loved, and her solution is to abandon the present, and the overwhelming pain.  The seamless narrative lands her in a medieval seaside village where mermaids wash ashore, devils haunt in packs, a child is born with the head of a fish, and where one day, quite out of nowhere, there emerges a sage and wandering leper.  The leper leads a small group of the villagers, including the protagonist, on a journey to Jerusalem, a harrowing pilgrimage that compels all the travelers to confront their deepest selves.<br><br>Exquisite and lyrical, <b>The Lepers Companions</b> is a heart-rending tale by one of our most fiercely original storytellers.<br><br><br><br><br>

    - An auspicious debut novel by a young writer who will remind readers of Anne Lamott and Anne Tyler<br><br>Crime in the Neighborhood centers on a headline event-- the molestation and murder of a twelve-year-old boy in a Washington, D.C., suburb. At the time of the murder, 1973, Marsha was nine years old and as an adult she still remembers that summer as a time when murder and her own family's upheaval were intertwined. Everyone, it seemed to Marsha at the time, was committing crimes. Her father deserted his family to take up with her mother's younger sister. Her teenage brother and sister were smoking and shoplifting, and her mother was "flirting" with Mr. Green, the new next-door neighbor. Even the president of the United States seemed to be a crook. But it is Marsha's own suspicions about who committed this crime that has the town up in arms and reveals what happens when fear runs wild.<br>

    - National Bestseller<br><br>In her stunning first novel, <b>Amy and Isabelle</b>, Elizabeth Strout evokes a teenager's alienation from her distant mother--and a parent's rage at the discovery of her daughter's sexual secrets. In most ways, Isabelle and Amy are like any mother and her 16-year-old daughter, a fierce mix of love and loathing exchanged in their every glance. And eating, sleeping, and working side by side in the gossip-ridden mill town of Shirley Falls doesn't help matters. But when Amy is discovered behind the steamed-up windows of a car with her math teacher, the vast and icy distance between mother and daughter becomes unbridgeable.<br><br>As news of the scandal reaches every ear, it is Isabelle who suffers from the harsh judgment of Shirley Falls, intensifying her shame about her own secret past. And as Amy seeks comfort elsewhere, she discovers the fragility of human happiness through other dramas, from the horror of a missing child to the trials of Fat Bev, the community peacemaker. Witty and often profound, <b>Amy and Isabelle</b> confirms Elizabeth Strout as a powerful new talent.<br><br><br><br>

    - In the spring of 1946, Evelyn Sert stands on the deck of a ship bound for Palestine. For the twenty-year-old from London, it is a time of adventure and change when all things seem possible.  <br><br>   Swept up in the spirited, chaotic churning of her new, strange country, she joins a kibbutz, then moves on to the teeming metropolis of Tel Aviv, to find her own home and a group of friends as eccentric and disparate as the city itself. She falls in love with a man who is not what he seems when she becomes an unwitting spy for a nation fighting to be born. <i>When I Lived in Modern Times</i> is "an unsentimental coming-of-age story of both a country and a young immigrant . . . that provides an unforgettable glimpse of a time and place rarely observed" (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>, starred review).  <br><br>  "Informed, intelligent . . . vital, original." (<i>The New York Times</i>)  <br><br>  "Deeply moving . . . at once a beautifully rendered story of one woman's coming of age, and a gripping portrait of the last days of British rule."

    - Rosina Lippi
    - Each life has its place, and every variation ripples the surface of the tiny alpine village called Rosenau. Be it a mysteriously misaddressed love letter or a girl's careless delivery of two helpless relatives into Nazi hands, the town's balance is ever tested, and ever tender. Here is a novel spanning eighty years -- years that bring factories and wars, store-bought cheese and city-trained teachers -- weaving the fates of the wives, mothers, and daughters in this remote corner of Austria. To quote Rosellen Brown, "the women in this haunting book are deeply and uniquely of their place, yet they speak (often wordlessly) of women's longings and satisfactions everywhere."

    - Fred and Edie (Sceptre 21's)
    - Book
    - Jill Dawson
    - "In December 1922, Edith Thompson, a smart, bright, lower-middle class woman who worked in a milliner's shop, was tried for conspiring with her young lover Frederick Bywaters to murder her husband, Percy. The sensational trial, which took place in front of heaving crowds at the Old Bailey, unravelled a real life drama as exciting as any blockbuster: an illicit love affair, a back-street abortion, domestic violence, murder and a double execution. \"Fred and Edie\" draws together powerful threads between personal memory and public lives, between innocence and responsibility, and between fact and fiction. It is an exploration of a woman caught in the net of her own private fantasy and the conflicts of the era in which she lived, of her muddled attempt to defy convention and reshape her own destiny, and, finally, of the devastation she left in her wake."

    - Book
    - Kate Grenville
    - Harley Savage is a plain woman, a part-time museum curator and quilting expert with three failed marriages and a heart condition. Douglas Cheeseman is a shy, gawky engineer with jug-handle ears, one marriage gone sour, and a crippling lack of physical courage. They meet in the little Australian town of Karakarook, where Harley has arrived to help the town build a heritage museum and Douglas to demolish the quaint old Bent Bridge. From the beginning they are on a collision course until the unexpected sets them both free.   <BR><BR>  Elegantly and compassionately told, <I>The Idea of Perfection</I> is reminiscent of the work of Carol Shields and Annie Proulx and reveals Kate Grenville as "a writer of extraordinary talent" (<I>The New York Times Book Review</I>).

    - Chloe Hooper
    - Kate Byrne is having an affair with the father of her most gifted pupil, Lucien. Unnervingly, her lover's wife has just published Murder at Black Swan Point, a true crime novel about the brutal slaying of a young adulteress. When Lucien displays violent imagery in his crayon sketches, Kate wonders how well her pupil understands his mother's grisly work, and why he's exposed to it. Suspecting the adult account of Black Swan Point's murder to be wrong, Kate imagines her own version of the novel, for children, narrated by Australian animals. But has her obsession with the crime aligned her fate with that of the murdered adulteress? Chloe Hooper brilliantly portrays a young woman reluctant to enter or conform to the world of adults. Kate Byrne is compelled by the lives of her nine-year-old students, a misfit among their parents. And though Lucien's father brings her to life sexually in scenes of escalating eroticism, he does nothing to penetrate her obsession with the past. Kate is fixated on the crime of passion that occurred years earlier, less and less aware of her own reputation in the present.

When the father\xE2\x80\x99s sudden illlness forces the children to come together, their deep fears and prejudices come to the surface, raising issues about kinship, trust, and hatred.

    - "The Siege is Helen Dunmore's masterpiece. Her canvas is  monumental -- the Nazis' 1941 winter siege on Leningrad that killed  six hundred thousand -- but her focus is heartrendingly intimate. One  family, the Levins, fights to stay alive in their small apartment,  held together by the unlikely courage and resourcefulness of  twenty-two-year-old Anna. Though she dreams of an artist's life, she  must instead forage for food in the ever more desperate city and watch  her little brother grow cruelly thin. Their father, a blacklisted  writer who once advocated a robust life of the mind, withers in spirit  and body. At such brutal times everything is tested. And yet Dunmore's  inspiring story shows that even then, the triumph of the human heart  is that love need not fall away.   Amid the  turmoil of the siege, the unimaginable happens -- two people enter the  Levins' frozen home and bring a kind of romance where before there was  only bare survival. A sensitive young doctor becomes Anna's devoted  partner, and her father is allowed a transcendent final episode with a  mysterious woman from his past.  "

Moving seamlessly between three family members, Donovan's clear-eyed, richly expressive prose sings off the page. Each character's voice has its own subtle rhythm and the conclusion is a poignant mixture of hope and lingering reservations. "Buddha Da" is a delight from one of Britain's best writers.

    - "<B>\"A gripping story of courage, disillusionment, survival, and the triumph of the human spirit.\"\xE2\x80\x94Sarah Durant, author of <I>The Birth of Venus</I></B>    <P>Loyalties, beliefs, love, family ties: all are tested to the limit in one of the most devastating moments of human history: the siege of Leningrad during World War II. Boris Aleksandrovich, a well-meaning bureaucrat, thinks he can negotiate between idealism and politics. His daughter, Natasha, learns otherwise when, as a young woman in love, she is almost crushed by her father's compromises. Watching all this unfold is Irina. Wise, ironic, marvelous Irina, whom Boris had persuaded to go on an ill-fated voyage to the Arctic Circle, where she barely survived. When she arrives back in Leningrad, he feels honor bound to find her a position within his family circle. Irina comes to understand how love for another may, in the end, be more powerful and more profound than blind loyalty to an idea. Exciting and heroic, peopled with wonderfully complex characters, <I>Ice Road</I> is a masterpiece. A finalist for the Orange Prize."

Her wealthy Catholic father, under whose shadow Kambili lives, while generous and politically active in the community, is repressive and fanatically religious at home.<br><br>When Nigeria begins to fall apart under a military coup, Kambili's father sends her and her brother away to stay with their aunt, a University professor, whose house is noisy and full of laughter. There, Kambili and her brother discover a life and love beyond the confines of their father's authority. The visit will lift the silence from their world and, in time, give rise to devotion and defiance that reveal themselves in profound and unexpected ways.

Set in California, <I>Liars and Saints</I> follows four generations of the Catholic Santerre family from World War II to the present. In a family driven as much by jealousy and propriety as by love, an unspoken tradition of deceit is passed from generation to generation. When tragedy shatters their precarious domestic lives, it takes astonishing courage and compassion to bring them back together. By turns funny and disturbing, irreverent and profound, <I>Liars and Saints</I> is a masterful display of Maile Meloy's prodigious gifts and of her penetrating insight into an extraordinary American family and into the nature of human love.

    - Book
    - Sheri Holman
    - "An Our Town for our times, The Mammoth Cheese is beautifully crafted and driven by warm, vibrant characters as it follows the residents of rural Three Chimneys, Virginia, on their journey to re-create the original Thomas Jefferson-era, 1,235-pound \"Mammoth Cheese.\" As the book opens, the town is joyously celebrating the birth of the Frank Eleven: eleven babies simultaneously born to Manda and James Frank after fertility treatments.  But as autumn progresses and the babies weaken, the community seeks to redeem itself through the making and transporting of a symbolic Mammoth Cheese to Washington, as a gift for the newly elected President Brooke. The cheese is the brainchild of August Vaughn, a farmhand by day and a President Jefferson impersonator by night, and the creation of Margaret Prickett, a single mother and cheese maker trying to save her century-old family farm. Sheri Holman seamlessly weaves together the lives of Three Chimneys, delving into her characters' inescapable family histories as they grapple with religion, divorce, politics, and unrequited love. The Mammoth Cheese is a triumphant exploration of the burdens and joys of rural America and the debts we owe to history, our parents, and ourselves."

    - Rachel Cusk
    - <P>Set over the course of one rainy day in a London suburb, <I>Arlington</I><I> Park</I> is a viciously funny portrait of a group of young mothers, each bound to their families, each straining for some kind of independence. As the hours pass, Rachel Cusk's graceful, incisive prose passes through the experience of each mother, following them all from the early-morning scrambling, through car trips and visits to the mall, and finally to a dinner party in the evening, when the husbands return and all the conflicts come to the surface. Penetrating and empathetic, <I>Arlington Park</I> is "a domestic adventure about the perils of modern privilege that is as smartly satirical as it is warmly wise" (<I>Elle</I>).</P>

    - "A best seller in France, with over 400,000 copies sold, and currently being translated into eighteen languages, <I>Fault Lines </I>is the new novel from internationally-acclaimed and best-selling author Nancy Huston. Huston's novel is a profound and poetic story that traces four generations of a single family from present-day California to WW II\xC2\xA8Cera Germany. <I>Fault Lines</I> begins with Sol, a gifted, terrifying child whose mother believes he is destined for greatness partly because he has a birthmark like his dad, his grandmother, and his great-grandmother. When Sol's family makes an unexpected trip to Germany, secrets begin to emerge about their history during World War II. It seems birthmarks are not all that's been passed down through the bloodlines. Closely observed, lyrically told, and epic in scope, <I>Fault Lines</I> is a touching, fearless, and unusual novel about four generations of children and their parents. The story moves from the West Coast of the United States to the East, from Haifa to Toronto to Munich, as secrets unwind back through time until a devastating truth about the family's origins is reached. Huston tells a riveting, vigorous tale in which love, music, and faith rage against the shape of evil."

As she steps onto her veranda, wrapped in a kimono with three black cranes swooping across the back, her world is suddenly and irrevocably altered. In the numbing aftermath of the atomic bomb that obliterates everything she has known, all that remains are the bird-shaped burns on her back, an indelible reminder of the world she has lost. In search of new beginnings, two years later, Hiroko travels to Delhi. It is there that her life will become intertwined with that of Konrad's half sister, Elizabeth, her husband, James Burton, and their employee Sajjad Ashraf, from whom she starts to learn Urdu. </P><P>With the partition of India, and the creation of Pakistan, Hiroko will find herself displaced once again, in a world where old wars are replaced by new conflicts. But the shadows of history--personal and political--are cast over the interrelated worlds of the Burtons, the Ashrafs, and the Tanakas as they are transported from Pakistan to New York and, in the novel's astonishing climax, to Afghanistan in the immediate wake of 9/11. The ties that have bound these families together over decades and generations are tested to the extreme, with unforeseeable consequences. </P>

    - Book
    - Deirdre Madden
    - "Dublin, Midsummer: While absent in New York, the celebrated actor Molly Fox has loaned her house to a playwright friend, who is struggling to write a new work. Over the course of this, the longest day of the year, the playwright reflects upon her own life, Molly's, and that of their mutual friend Andrew, whom she has known since university. Why does Molly never celebrate her own birthday, which falls upon this day? What does it mean to be a playwright or an actor? How have their relationships evolved over the course of many years? Molly Fox's Birthday calls into question the ideas that we hold about who we are; and shows how the past informs the present in ways we might never have imagined."

    - Ellen Feldman
    - "<strong>Set in the 1930s South, this resonant novel of race and class turns on the awful power of a lie.</strong>  Alabama, 1931. A posse stops a freight train and arrests nine black youths, ranging in age from thirteen to nineteen. Their crime: fighting with white boys. Then two white girls, dressed in men\xE2\x80\x99s overalls, emerge from another freight car. Though they show no signs of abuse, fast as anyone can say Jim Crow, the cry of rape goes up. <br />  <br />  One of the girls sticks to her story. The other changes her tune, again and again. While the NAACP and the Communist Party vie to save the boys\xE2\x80\x99 lives and make political hay, and a wily criminal lawyer renowned for defending underworld characters battles age-old prejudices, a young journalist fights to rescue the nine youths from the electric chair, redeem the girl who repents her lie, and make amends for her own past. <br />  <br />  Intertwining historical actors with fictional characters and stirring racism, sexism, and anti-Semitism in an explosive brew, <em>Scottsboro</em> is a novel of a case and a cause that roiled the nation for almost half a century. No crime in American history, let alone a crime that never occurred, resulted in as many trials, convictions, reversals, and seminal Supreme Court decisions. It destroyed lives, forged careers, and brought out the best\xE2\x80\x94and the worst\xE2\x80\x94in the men and women who fought for the cause. ."

    - "On 2 March 1908, nineteen-year-old Lazarus Averbuch, a Russian Jewish immigrant to Chicago, tried to deliver a letter to the home of the city's Chief of Police, George Shippy. Instead of taking the letter, Shippy shot Averbuch twice, killing him. Lazarus Averbuch, Shippy claimed, was an anarchist assassin and an agent of foreign operatives who wanted to bring the United States to its knees. His sister, Olga, was left alone and bereft in a city - and country - seething with political and ethnic tensions. In the twenty-first century, Brik, a young Bosnian writer in Chicago, becomes obsessed with finding out the truth of what happened to Lazarus. And so Brik and his friend Rora, a charming and unreliable photographer, set off on a journey back to Lazarus Averbuch's birthplace, through a history of pogroms and poverty and a present of gangsters and prostitutes.'Masterful ...troubling, funny and redemptive ...ingenious ...Hemon is as much a writer of the senses as of the intellect. He can be very funny: the novel is full of jokes and linguistic riffs that justify comparisons to Nabokov' - \"Washington Post\". 'The fearless and spirited expression of a turbulent literary talent ...For all Hemon's nods to other writers - one catches glimpses not only of Nabokov and Sebald but of Bulgakov, Pamuk, Amis, Poe - he is entirely his own man, an original who owes no debts to anyone' - Patrick McGrath, \"Book Forum\".  'Profoundly moving ...A literary page-turner that combines narrative momentum with meditations on identity and mortality' - Kirkus."

Dodging the false beacons of memory and legend, Marianne amasses disparate clues -- photographs and hospital records, newspaper clippings and a rare white turquoise bracelet -- to recover those moments that went unrecorded, \"to hear the words only the silent ones can speak.\" <I>The Shadow Catcher,</i> fueled by the great American passions for love and land and family, chases the silhouettes of our collective history into the bright light of the present."

    - Monica Ali
    - Monica Ali's gorgeous first novel is the deeply moving story of one woman, Nazneen, born in a Bangladeshi village and transported to London at age eighteen to enter into an arranged marriage. Already hailed by the London <I>Observer</I> as "one of the most significant British novelists of her generation," Ali has written a stunningly accomplished debut about one outsider's quest to find her voice.<P><I>What could not be changed must be borne. And since nothing could be changed, everything had to be borne. This principle ruled her life. It was mantra, fettle, and challenge.</I><P>Nazneen's inauspicious entry into the world, an apparent stillbirth on the hard mud floor of a village hut, imbues in her a sense of fatalism that she carries across continents when she is married off to Chanu, a man old enough to be her father. Nazneen moves to London and, for years, keeps house, cares for her husband, and bears children, just as a girl from the village is supposed to do. But gradually she is transformed by her experience, and begins to question whether fate controls her or whether she has a hand in her own destiny. <P>Motherhood is a catalyst -- Nazneen's daughters chafe against their father's traditions and pride -- and to her own amazement, Nazneen falls in love with a young man in the community. She discovers both the complexity that comes with free choice and the depth of her attachment to her husband, her daughters, and her new world.<P>While Nazneen journeys along her path of self-realization, her sister, Hasina, rushes headlong at her life, first making a "love marriage," then fleeing her violent husband. Woven through the novel, Hasina's letters from Dhaka recount a world of overwhelming adversity. Shaped, yet not bound, by their landscapes and memories, both sisters struggle to dream -- and live -- beyond the rules prescribed for them.<P>Vivid, profoundly humane, and beautifully rendered, <I>Brick Lane</I> captures a world at once unimaginable and achingly familiar. And it establishes Monica Ali as a thrilling new voice in fiction. As <I>Kirkus Reviews</I> said, "She is one of those dangerous writers who see everything."

It's V-J Day, the war is over, and Roscoe Conway, after twenty-six years as the second in command of Albany's notorious political machine, decides to quit politics forever. But there's no way out, and only his Machiavellian imagination can help him cope with the erupting disasters. Every step leads back to the past-to the early loss of his true love, the takeover of city hall, the machine's fight with FDR and Al Smith to elect a governor, and the methodical assassination of gangster Jack "Legs" Diamond. "Thick with crime, passion, and backroom banter" (<i>The New Yorker</i>), <i>Roscoe</i> is an odyssey of great scope and linguistic verve, a deadly, comic masterpiece from one of America's most important writers.

    - "'John Henry Days' is a novel of extraordinary scope and mythic power. Recognised as one of the novels of 2001, it establishes Colson Whitehead as one of the pre-eminent young American writers of our time.  Building the railways that made America, John Henry died with a hammer in his hand moments after competing against a steam drill in a battle of endurance. The story of his death made him a legend.  Over a century later, J. Sutter, a freelance journalist and accomplished expense account abuser, is sent to West Virginia to cover the launch of a new postage stamp at the first 'John Henry Days' festival.  John Henry Days is a riveting portrait of America. Through a patchwork of interweaving histories Colson Whitehead triumphantly reveals how a nation creates its present through the stories it tells of its past."

As the festivities unfold (and the cash bar opens), everyone has an opinion and a lively prediction about April and Caleb's union, each the reflection of a different marital experience.</P><P>Meanwhile, at the nearby Hideaway Lodge, a domestic quarrel ends in tragedy. As April and Caleb's life together begins, death parts another man and woman in angry violence -- and as the two stories gradually intersect, their juxtaposition explores the tangled roots of vulnerability and desire.</P><P>By the time the last polka has been danced and the bouquet tossed, <I>Midnight Champagne</I> has cast an extraordinary spell.

    - Book
    - Frederick Busch
    - An immensely powerful story, The Night Inspector follows the extraordinary life of William Bartholomew, a maimed veteran of the Civil War, as he returns from the battlefields to New York City, bent on reversing his fortunes. It is there he meets Jessie, a Creole prostitute who engages him in a venture that has its origins in the complexities and despair of the conflict he has left behind. He also befriends a deputy inspector of customs named Herman Melville who, largely forgotten as a writer, is condemned to live in the wake of his vanished literary success and in the turmoil of his fractured family.<br><br>Delving into the depths of this country's heart and soul, Frederick Busch's stunning novel is a gripping portrait of a nation trying to heal from the ravages of war--and of one man's attempt to recapture a taste for life through the surging currents of his own emotions, ambitions, and shattered conscience.

    - "In these stories, the author of <I>Jernigan</I> (runner-up for the Pulitzer Prize) and <I>Preston Falls</I> (finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award) illuminates with unflinching vision and hard-earned compassion a great variety of lives:  men and women, young and old, in thrall to--or in flight from--jobs less creative than the echoing past had promised, as their parents, siblings or children die, implode or (perhaps just as bad) flourish. Gates's people know their Hopper, Huysmans and Haggard,<br>their Beckett, Bartoli and Billie Holiday, more confidently than they know their families, friends and lovers.<P>Yet they're terrifyingly self-aware, and refuse to go gently--even when they're going nowhere fast. The author the <I>New York Times</I> calls \"a novelist of the very first order\" now stakes a similar claim as a writer<br>of short fiction.<P>My first thought of the day is:  And we are supposedly good people.

They began to be surrounded by a pulsing radiance, and I thought I saw some of them passing right through others. It didn't<br>strike me as out of the ordinary. (\"The Mail Lady\")"

    - David Gates
    - "\"Beautifully written.... Gates [has a] pitch-perfect ear for contemporary speech...and...[a] keen, journalistic eye.\"--Michiko Kakutani, <i>The New York Times</i><P>In this comic, fiercely compassionate novel, David Gates, whose first novel Jernigan was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize, sends his protagonist on a visceral journey to the dark side of suburban masculinity, explores the claims youth makes on middle age, and the tenacious --at times perverse--power of love to assert itself.<P>When Doug Willis has a mid-life crisis, he doesn't join a gym or have an affair. Instead he gets himself arrested while camping with his wife and kids, takes a two month leave of absence from his PR job, and retreats to his farmhouse in rural Preston Falls--where he plugs in his guitar and tries to shut out his life.<P>While his wife, Jean, struggles to pay the bills and raise their sullen, skeptical kids, Willis's plans for hiatus crumble into Dewars-and-cocaine fueled disarray. A shattered window, an unguarded gun, and a shady small town attorney force a crisis--and Willis can't go home again. With its biting humor and harsh realism, Preston Falls confirms David Gates as a talent in the tradition of Russell Banks and Richard Ford:  a master of dark truths and private longings.<br>"

    - Charles Frazier
    - <B>Cold Mountain</B> is an extraordinary novel about a  soldier's perilous journey back to his beloved at the end of the Civil  War. At once a magnificent love story and a harrowing account of one  man's long walk home, <B>Cold Mountain</B> introduces a stunning new talent  in American literature.  <P>  Based on local history and family stories passed down by the author's  great-great-grandfather, <B>Cold Mountain </B> is the tale of a wounded  soldier, Inman, who walks away from the ravages of the war and back  home to his prewar sweetheart, Ada. Inman's odyssey through the  devastated landscape of the soon-to-be-defeated South interweaves with  Ada's struggle to revive her father's farm, with the help of an  intrepid young drifter named Ruby. As their long-separated lives begin  to converge at the close of the war, Inman and Ada confront the vastly  transformed world they've been delivered.  <P>  Charles Frazier reveals marked insight into man's relationship to the  land and the dangers of solitude. He also shares with the great  nineteenth-century novelists a keen observation of a society  undergoing change. Cold Mountain re-creates a world gone by that  speaks eloquently to our time.  <P>  Charles Frazier grew up in the mountains of North Carolina. He now  lives in Raleigh with his wife and daughter, where they raise  horses. <B>Cold Mountain</B> is his first novel.

In these fourteen stories, Dubus depicts ordinary men and women confronting injury and loneliness, the lack of love and the terror of actually having it. Out of his characters' struggles and small failures--and their unexpected moments of redemption--Dubus creates fiction that bears comparison to the short story's greatest creators--Chekhov, Raymond Carver, Flannery O'Connor. <br><p><br>"A master of the short story...It's good to have Andre Dubus back. More than ever, he is an object of hope."--Philadelphia Inquirer<br><br><br>"Dubus's detailed creation of three-dimensional characters is propelled by his ability to turn a quiet but perfect phrase...[This] kind of writing raises gooseflesh of admiration."--San Francisco Chronicle

    - Book
    - Henry Roth
    - Henry Roth went to sleep for the last time on the evening of October 13, 1995, but not before completing this transcendent novel, which continues "one of the most poignant projects in American literature."  As Tolstoy presaged his own passing in T<i>he Death of Ivan Ilyich</i>, Roth examines his own imminent death in the most lyrical of ways, telling the story of the elderly writer, Ira Stigman, who in spite of his physical frailties, finds solace and redemption through the re-creation of the fascinating love triangle of his youth.  Capturing the dizzying vitality of the 1920s and the literary world of Manhattan, Roth has set the stage for one of the most memorable literary romances of this century.<br>

    - Beatrice Hempel, English teacher, is the sort of teacher students adore. "Ms Hempel Chronicles" is a warm-hearted novel about a young woman navigating her way into adulthood as she ushers her students into adolescence. Ms Beatrice Hempel, English teacher, is new - new to teaching, new to her school, newly engaged, and newly bereft of her devoted father. Overwhelmed by her newness, she struggles to figure out what is expected of her in life and at work. Is it acceptable to introduce swear words into the English curriculum, enlist students to write their own report cards, or bring up personal experiences while teaching a sex-education class? Sarah Shun-Lien Bynum finds her characters at their most vulnerable, then explores those precarious moments in sharp, graceful prose. Ms Hempel Chronicles takes the reader on a journey down the rabbit hole to the wonderland of middle school, memory, daydreaming, and the extraordinary business of growing up.

    - The year is 1929, and newlyweds George and Serena Pemberton travel from Boston to the North Carolina mountains where they plan to create a timber empire. Although George has already lived in the camp long enough to father an illegitimate child, Serena is new to the mountains -- but she soon shows herself to be the equal of any man, overseeing crews, hunting rattle-snakes, even saving her husband's life in the wilderness. Together this lord and lady of the woodlands ruthlessly kill or vanquish all who fall out of favor. Yet when Serena learns that she will never bear a child, she sets out to murder the son George fathered without her. Mother and child begin a struggle for their lives, and when Serena suspects George is protecting his illegitimate family, the Pembertons' intense, passionate marriage starts to unravel as the story moves toward its shocking reckoning. <P>Rash's masterful balance of violence and beauty yields a riveting novel that, at its core, tells of love both honored and betrayed. </P>

The best bones weren\xE2\x80\x99t on trails\xE2\x80\x94deer and moose don\xE2\x80\x99t die conveniently\xE2\x80\x94and soon I was wandering so far into the woods that I needed a map and compass to find my way home. When winter came and snow blew into the mountains, burying the bones, I continued to spend my days and often my nights in the woods. I vaguely understood that I was doing this because I could no longer think; I found relief in walking up hills. When the night temperatures dropped below zero, I felt visited by necessity, a baseline purpose, and I walked for miles, my only objective to remain upright, keep moving, preserve warmth. When I was lost, I told myself stories . . .\xE2\x80\x9D<br><br></i>So Charles D\xE2\x80\x99Ambrosio recounted his life in Philipsburg, Montana, the genesis of the brilliant stories collected here, six of which originally appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i>. Each of these eight burnished, terrifying, masterfully crafted stories is set against a landscape that is both deeply American and unmistakably universal. A son confronts his father\xE2\x80\x99s madness and his own hunger for connection on a misguided hike in the Pacific Northwest. A screenwriter fights for his sanity in the bleak corridors of a Manhattan psych ward while lusting after a ballerina who sets herself ablaze. A Thanksgiving hunting trip in Northern Michigan becomes the scene of a haunting reckoning with marital infidelity and desperation. And in the magnificent title story, carpenters building sets for a porn movie drift dreamily beneath a surface of sexual tension toward a racial violence they will never fully comprehend. Taking place in remote cabins, asylums, Indian reservations, the backloads of Iowa and the streets of Seattle, this collection of stories, as muscular and challenging as the best novels, is about people who have been orphaned, who have lost connection, and who have exhausted the ability to generate meaning in their lives. Yet in the midst of lacerating difficulty, the sensibility at work <br>in these fictions boldly insists on the enduring power of love. D\xE2\x80\x99Ambrosio conjures a world that is fearfully inhospitable, darkly humorous, and touched by glory; here are characters, tested by every kind of failure, who struggle to remain human, whose lives have been sharpened rather than numbed by adversity, whose apprehension of truth and beauty has been deepened rather than defeated by their troubles. Many writers speak of the abyss. Charles D\xE2\x80\x99Ambrosio writes as if he is inside of it, gazing upward, and the gaze itself is redemptive, a great yearning ache, poignant and wondrous, equal parts grit and grace.<br><br>A must read for everyone who cares about literary writing, <i>The Dead Fish Museum</i> belongs on the same shelf with the best American short fiction."

Now, in her newest collection, she demonstrates once again her virtuosic abilities in precisely distilled, perfectly shaped studies of human connection and disconnection. From a group of friends whose luck in acquiring a luxurious Manhattan sublet turns to disaster as their balcony becomes a front-row seat to the catastrophe of 9/11, to the too painful love of a brother for his schizophrenic sister, Eisenberg brilliantly "illustrates the lives of people rubbed raw by what the fates have sent them" (<I>Vanity Fair</I>).

    - All Aunt Hagar's Children
    - Book
    - Edward P. Jones
    - In fourteen sweeping and sublime stories, five of which have been published in The New Yorker, the bestselling and Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Known World shows that his grasp of the human condition is firmer than ever     <P>Returning to the city that inspired his first prizewinning book, Lost in the City, Jones has filled this new collection with people who call Washington, D.C., home. Yet it is not the city's power brokers that most concern him but rather its ordinary citizens. All Aunt Hagar's Children turns an unflinching eye to the men, women, and children caught between the old ways of the South and the temptations that await them further north, people who in Jones's masterful hands, emerge as fully human and morally complex, whether they are country folk used to getting up with the chickens or people with centuries of education behind them.     <P>In the title story, in which Jones employs the first-person rhythms of a classic detective story, a Korean War veteran investigates the death of a family friend whose sorry destiny seems inextricable from his mother's own violent Southern childhood. In "In the Blink of God's Eye" and "Tapestry" newly married couples leave behind the familiarity of rural life to pursue lives of urban promise only to be challenged and disappointed.     <P>With the legacy of slavery just a stone's throw away and the future uncertain, Jones's cornucopia of characters will haunt readers for years to come.

    - "The Maytrees: A Novel"
    - Book
    - Annie Dillard
    - <p> Toby Maytree first sees Lou Bigelow on her bicycle in postwar Provincetown, Massachusetts. Her laughter and loveliness catch his breath. Maytree is a Provincetown native, an educated poet of thirty. As he courts Lou, just out of college, her stillness draws him. Hands-off, he hides his serious wooing, and idly shows her his poems. </p> <p> In spare, elegant prose, Dillard traces the Maytrees' decades of loving and longing. They live cheaply among the nonconformist artists and writers that the bare tip of Cape Cod attracts. When their son Petie appears, their innocent Bohemian friend Deary helps care for him. But years later it is Deary who causes the town to talk. </p> <p> In this moving novel, Dillard intimately depicts willed bonds of loyalty, friendship, and abiding love. She presents nature's vastness and nearness. Warm and hopeful, <i>The Maytrees</i> is the surprising capstone of Dillard's original body of work. </p>

    - T. M. McNally
    - "\"Lordy, what a wickedly wise writer T. M. McNally is. <I>The   Gateway</I> is a terrific book, impatient and wrought up, a book that goes   a long way toward answering this age-old question: Why do fools fall in   love? Here are seven answers, each beguiling and break-neck and   bedeviling.\"--Lee K. Abbott<P>  \"McNally writes from the inside out. These dramatic contemplations on the   radical ways we connect in families show his remarkable vision. In prose at   once fierce and elegiac, these powerful stories compose a careful and   rueful celebration of our times.\"--Ron Carlson<P>  \"Uncommonly dense, complex, and well-made, these stories are vaultingly   ambitious, featuring a wide range of character and milieu. McNally's   recurring interests are tricky relationships with fathers, with God;   infidelity (on many levels); an obsession with history (especially World   War II); generational legacy/burden/shadow. Eliot said, `But there's no   vocabulary/For the love within a family./This love is silent.' <I>The   Gateway,</I> in what seems to me a minor miracle, finds the words.\"--David   Shields<P>  \"McNally is a contemporary American writer in that he is completely   unsentimental and accustomed to irony; but he is a rare writer for our   times in that his work contains a genuine wistfulness for gentler times,   gentler connections between husbands, wives, and children. It is the   wistfulness of diminished expectations without a loss of hope.\"--Tracy   Daugherty<P>  McNally's subject in the seven stories in this, his third story collection,   is love, always love. For him, these are religious stories for skeptics who   are spiritually inclined."

Here is another work in that tradition, about a simple prop manager who finds himself unexpectedly\xE2\x80\x94and literally\xE2\x80\x94pushed into the spotlight, and a player in world history.    <P>When Ivan Azerbaijan, known as Ivanushka, first set out for Moscow, he hoped for nothing more than to build sets for his mentor's production of <i>King Lear</i>. But when the lead falls suddenly ill, Ivanushka steps in and finds his performance the talk of Moscow. He falls under the scrutiny of Joseph Stalin, who allows starlet Valentina Michaelson to join the cast as Cordelia. Ivanushka is thrust headlong into the world of intrigue, terror, and distrust that was Stalin's Soviet Union.    <P>Charyn depicts both the romance between Valentina and Ivan and the chaos of life under Stalin's watchful eyes with similar style, making the fear and confusion palpable in this audacious winter's tale. <i>The Green Lantern</i> is an exploration of Shakespeare, the Soviet Union, and what it is to \"perform,\" by one of the great American writers."

    - Elroy and his wife, Clare, elect to try living separately, a choice characteristic of their relationship-fond, thoughtful, generous to a fault, and more than a little cracked. So Elroy leases a high-rise beach condo, begins hanging out with his twenty-something students, and experiences a splendid re-enchantment with the world. With his trademark precision and pitch-perfect dialogue, Barthelme elegantly lays open this interweaving of twenty-year olds with their fifty-something fellow traveler. The result is a lovely, lilting romance, and a spare yet generous masterpiece from a writer at the top of his form.

    - Book
    - Peter Cameron
    - <b>A wryly humorous, impeccably observed novel about the capriciousness of love</b><br><br>Omar Razaghi posts a letter on September 13, 1995 that will change the course of his life forever. A doctoral student at the University of Kansas, he writes to the estate of the Latin American author Jules Gund, requesting permission to write Gund's authorized biography. His request is refused, but Omar has already accepted a fellowship from the university, and with his girlfriend's vehement encouragement, he goes in person to Uruguay to petition to Gund's three executors. Although Caroline Gund, Jules' wife, and Arden Langdon, Jules' mistress and mother of his child, are initially opposed to the idea of a biography, Omar has the support of Adam, Jules' older brother, and hopes to be able to persuade the two women. Omar's unexpected arrival in Uruguay reverberates through this odd and isolated little family group, and his stay in the languid, dreamy Ochos Rios makes him question his former life in Kansas, and his ability-even his desire-to write an "authorized" life. <br><br>A novel about the random nature of love, and the ways in which we confront or avoid life's choices, <i>The City of Your Final Destination</i> is a touching, clever and wonderfully comic fourth novel from Peter Cameron.<br>

    - Gilbert Sorrentino
    - In this novel of superbly stylized fragments of memory, Sorrentino captures the grit of golden-era Brooklyn. Each episode, affectingly textured with naked detail, is followed by the narrator's deeper, more subjective climb down to the very bones of pure, poetic recollection. The reader, as though privy to a penetrating pyschological confession, accompanies the narrator, ferreting out the gristle and unconventional beauty found among the scrappy immigrant boys, hard-drinking blue-collar stiffs, and poor, sexy, and magenta-lipped women who inhabit the novel.

    - Karen Joy Fowler
    - Lizzie Hayes, a member of the San Francisco elite, is a   seemingly docile, middle-aged spinster praised for her volunteer work with the Ladies Relief and Protection Society Home, or "The Brown Ark". All she needs is the spark that will liberate her from the ruling conventions. When the wealthy and well-connected, but ill-reputed Mary Ellen Pleasant shows up at the Brown Ark, Lizzie is drawn to her.  It is the beautiful, but mysterious Mary Ellen, an outcast among the women of the elite because of her notorious past and her involvement in voodoo, who will eventually hold the key to unlocking Lizzie's rebellious nature.  <br><br>    Loosely based in historical fact, <i>Sister Noon</i> is a wryly funny, playfully mysterious, and totally subversive novel from this "fine writer" whose "language dazzles" (<i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>).  <br><br>  "<i>Sister Noon</i> is funny, lyrical, spooky, inspired . . . A work of enchanting rumination-and one of the year's best reads." (Michael Upchurch, <i>The Seattle Times</i>)

    - Claire Messud
    - "\"A Simple Tale\" is the moving account of Maria Poniatowski, an aging Ukrainian woman who was taken by the Germans for slave labor and eventually relocated to Canada as a displaced person. She struggles to provide her son Radek with every opportunity, but his eventual success increases the gulf between him and his mother. What of the past is she to preserve, and how to avoid letting the weight of that past burden the present? Maria's story is about the moments of connection and isolation that are common to us all.<br>\t\"The Hunters,\" the second novella, is narrated by an American academic spending a summer in London who grows obsessed by the neighbors downstairs. Ridley Wandor, a plump and insipid caretaker of the elderly, lives with her ever-unseen mother and a horde of pet rabbits she calls \"the hunters.\" While the narrator researches a book about death, all of Ridley Wandor's patients are dying. Loneliness breeds an active imagination. Is having such an imagination always destructive? Or can it be strong enough to create a new reality?<br>\tFar-flung settings and universal themes give a sweeping appeal to Claire Messud's work.<br>"

    - Millicent Dillon
    - Eschewing the confines of traditional biography and inverting the glamour of espionage, acclaimed biographer Millicent Dillon blends fact and fiction to chronicle the human drama of Harry Gold, the American chemist who became a Soviet spy.  <br><br>  In casting Gold's story as a novel, Dillon creates a gripping narrative from the true events of political life in America from the thirties through the McCarthy era, from Gold's recruitment to his training in tradecraft to his role in Julius Rosenberg's and Klaus Fuchs's atomic espionage at Los Alamos. The result is a novel with the psychological depth of Graham Greene's <i>The Third Man</i>, the taut pacing of <i>All the President' s Men</i>, and the moral poignancy of Phillip Roth's <i>I Married A Communist</i>.

In spite of outward appearances -- he holds a respectable university teaching position; he is an articulate and attractive addition to local social life -- he's a dead man walking.</P><P>Nothing can touch Reed, nothing can move him, although he observes with a mordant clarity the lives whirling vigorously around him.

In this atmosphere characterized, as he says, \"by cynicism, occasional brilliance, and small, polite terror,\" he manages, against all his expectations, to find people to light his way through his private labyrinth.</P><P>Elegant and incisively observed, <I>The Name of the World</I> is Johnson at his best: poignant yet unsentimental, replete with the visionary imaginative detail for which his work is known.

Woven into Bea's story are stories of other lifelong residents of Green Bay and the changes time brings to a town and its residents.

    - The Doctor Stories
    - Book
    - Richard Selzer
    - "<i>The Doctor Stories</i> is Richard Selzer's selection of his own short stories, culled from three decades of writing, along with two new stories and an introduction detailing his literary beginnings.  Drawing from his classic books, Selzer portrays the interactions of people at moments of crisis and drama.  His signature style is apparent in every sentence:  humane, observant, passionately descriptive, and particular, always connecting the intimate with the largest questions of life and death.<br>"

    - The Hundred Brothers
    - Book
    - Donald Antrim
    - "There's Rob, Bob, Tom, Paul, Ralph, and Phil; Siegfried, the sculptor in burning steel; blind Albert and ninety-three-year-old Hiram; Foster, the New Age psychoanalyst; and Maxwell, the tropical botanist, who, since returning from the rain forest, has seemed a little screwed up somehow.  When PEN/Faulkner Award finalist Donald Antrim brings them and their eighty-nine equally eccentic kinsmen together in the decaying library of their family estate for cocktails, a light supper, and a little ritual sacrifice, the result suggests a high-speed collision between The Brothers Karamazov and the Brothers Marx.  Moving swiftly from slapstick to horror and back, The Hundred Brothers establishes Antrim as one of our most mordantly and satanically playful young writers, whose insights into the agonies of kinship are as serious as they are hilarious.

    - The Mercy Seat
    - Book
    - Rilla Askew
    - Few first novels garner the kind of powerful praise awarded this epic story that takes place on the dusty, remorseless Oklahoma frontier, where two brothers are deadlocked in a furious rivalry. Fayette is an enterprising schemer hoping to cash in on his brother's talents as a gunsmith. John, determined not to repeat the crime that forced both families to flee their Kentucky homes, doggedly follows his tenacious brother west, while he watches his own family disintegrate.  Wondrously told through the wary eyes of John's ten-year-old daughter, Mattie, whose gift of premonition proves to be both a blessing and a curse, The Mercy Seat resounds with the rhythms of the Old Testament even as it explores the mysteries of the Native American spirit world. Sharing Faulkner's understanding of the inescapable pull of family and history, and Cormac McCarthy's appreciation of the stark beauty of the American wilderness, Rilla Askew imbues this momentous work with her tremendous energy and emotional range. It is an extraordinary novel from a prodigious new talent. <br>  <i>Strange Business</i>, a collection of linked stories that won the 1993 Oklahoma Book Award, is available from Penguin

    - Kate Wheeler
    - Kate Wheeler's stories feature peripatetic Americans who seek love or enlightenment - or both - in far-flung corners of the globe. A startling mixture of gentle irony, mischievous humor, and unexpected danger marks the paths of all these characters as they follow their circuitous routes toward happiness. As THE NEW YORK TIMES said, "Wheeler has a capacity for compressing the insights of cross-cultural dislocation into deliciously memorable epiphanies."

Within its pages, note such sights as: a study of the motives and strategies used by the participants in the game of Clue, including the seduction of Miss Scarlet by Colonel Mustard; the Barnum Museum, a fantastic, monstrous landmark so compelling that an entire town finds its citizens gradually and inexorably disappearing into it; a bored dilettante who constructs an imaginary woman--and loses her to an imaginary man!--and a legendary magician so skilled at sleight-of-hand that he is pursued by police for the crime of erasing the line between the real and the conjured.<br><br><br>Ingeniously written and orchestrated, each exhibit in <i>The Barnum Museum</i> will compel you to continue, each story becoming a lure to the next."

Told by his articulate, equally scarred younger brother, Wade's story becomes as spellbinding and inexorable as a fuse burning its way to the dynamite.

    - An injury at birth left Audrey with a wandering eye. Though flawed, the bad eye functions well enough to permit her an idiosyncratic view of the world, one she welcomes in the stifling postwar Brooklyn of the 1950s. During a journey to Manhattan to see a doctor about her sight, she begins to explore the sexual rites of adulthood. But can her romance last? In this beautifully observed novel, Lynne Sharon Schwartz raises themes of innocence and escape while illuminating the rich inner life of a singular girl.

When  Carlos Ruweda's wife is suddenly taken from him, he  discovers a magical gift: In waking dreams, he had  clear visions of the fates of \"the  disappeared.\" But he cannot \"imagine\" what  has happened to his own wife. Driven to near  madness, his mind cannot be taken away: imagination, stories, and  the mystical secrets of the human  spirit."

    - Carpenter's Gothic (Classic, 20th-Century, Penguin)
    - Book
    - William Gaddis
    - This story of raging comedy and despair centers on the tempestuous marriage of an heiress and a Vietnam veteran. From their "carpenter gothic" rented house, Paul sets himself up as a media consultant for Reverend Ude, an evangelist mounting a grand crusade that conveniently suits a mining combine bidding to take over an ore strike on the site of Ude's African mission. At the still center of the breakneck action--revealed in Gaddis's inimitable virtuoso dialoge--is Paul's wife, Liz, and over it all looms the shadowy figure of McCandless, a geologist from whom Paul and Liz rent their house. As Paul mishandles the situation, his wife takes the geologist to her bed and a fire and aborted assassination occur; Ude issues a call to arms as harrowing as any Jeremiad--and Armageddon comes rapidly closer. Displaying Gaddis's inimitable virtuoso dialogue, and his startling treatments of violence and sexuality, Carpenter's Gothic "shows again that Gaddis is among the first rank of contemporary American writers" (Malcolm Bradbury, <i>The Washington Post Book World</i>). <br> <br>"An unholy landmark of a novel--an extra turret added on to the ample, ingenious, audacious Gothic mansion Gaddis has been building in American letters" --Cynthia Ozick, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i> <br> <br>"Everything in this compelling and brilliant vision of America--the packaged sleaze, the incipient violence, the fundamentalist furor, the constricted sexuality--is charged with the force of a volcanic eruption. <i>Carpenter's Gothic</i> will reenergize and give shape to contemporary literature." --Walter Abish

    - "Lonesome Dove: A Novel"
    - Book
    - Larry McMurtry
    - "<P>Bestselling winner of the 1986 Pulitzer Prize, <I>Lonesome Dove</I> is an American classic. First published in 1985, Larry McMurtry's epic novel combined flawless writing with a storyline and setting that gripped the popular imagination, and ultimately resulted in a series of four novels and an Emmy-winning television miniseries. Now, with an introduction by the author, <I>Lonesome Dove</I> is reprinted in an S&S Classic Edition. <P> <I>Lonesome Dove,</I> by Larry McMurtry, the author of <I>Terms of Endearment,</I> is his long-awaited masterpiece, the major novel at last of the American West as it really was. <P> A love story, an adventure, an American epic, <I>Lonesome Dove</I> embraces <I>all</I> the West -- legend and fact, heroes and outlaws, whores and ladies, Indians and settiers -- in a novel that recreates the central American experience, the most enduring of our national myths. <P> Set in the late nineteenth century, <I>Lonesome Dove</I> is the story of a cattle drive from Texas to Montana -- and much more. It is a drive that represents for everybody involved not only a daring, even a foolhardy, adventure, but a part of the American Dream -- the attempt to carve out of the last remaining wilderness a new life. <P> Augustus McCrae and W. F. Call are former Texas Rangers, partners and friends who have shared hardship and danger together without ever quite understanding (or wanting to understand) each other's deepest emotions. Gus is the romantic, a reluctant rancher who has a way with women and the sense to leave well enough alone. Call is a driven, demanding man, a natural authority figure with no patience for weaknesses, and not many of his own. He is obsessed with the dream of creating his own empire, and with the need to conceal a secret sorrow of his own. The two men could hardly be more different, but both are tough, redoubtable fighters who have learned to count on each other, if nothing else. <P> Call's dream not only drags Gus along in its wake, but draws in a vast cast of characters: <P> -- Lorena, the whore with the proverbial heart of gold, whom Gus (and almost everyone else) loves, and who survives one of the most terrifying experiences any woman could have...<BR> -- Elmira, the restless, reluctant wife of a small-time Arkansas sheriff, who runs away from the security of marriage to become part of the great Western adventure...<BR> -- Blue Duck, the sinister Indian renegade, one of the most frightening villains in American fiction, whose steely capacity for cruelty affects the lives of everyone in the book...<BR> -- Newt, the young cowboy for whom the long and dangerous journey from Texas to Montana is in fact a search for his own identity...<BR> -- Jake, the dashing, womanizing exRanger, a comrade-in-arms of Gus and Call, whose weakness leads him to an unexpected fate...<BR> -- July Johnson, husband of Elmira, whose love for her draws him out of his secure life into the wilderness, and turns him into a kind of hero... <P> <I>Lonesome Dove</I> sweeps from the Rio Grande (where Gus and Call acquire the cattle for their long drive by raiding the Mexicans) to the Montana highlands (where they find themselves besieged by the last, defiant remnants of an older West). <P> It is an epic of love, heroism, loyalty, honor, and betrayal -- faultlessly written, unfailingly dramatic. <I>Lonesome Dove</I> is the novel about the West that American literature -- and the American reader -- has long been waiting for."

    - The Tree of Life
    - Book
    - Hugh Nissenson
    - Eighteen months of the life of Thomas Keene, a fictitious 19th-century congregational minister, is traced in this journal-like novel. Having suffered a loss of faith, Keene abandons the East for frontier life in the Ohio wilderness. His account is by turns violent, tender, and erotic. Keene is both a witness to history, describing the many ordinary and horrific details of frontier life (including the conflict between white settlers and Indians), and a man searching for personal meaning in a world without God. Like a true frontier journal, the novel includes illustrations attributed to Keene. As a foil to the main character, the historic figure John Chapman, better known as Johnny Appleseed, is portrayed as a believer who lives with self-doubt.

    - Jamaica Kincaid
    - Jamaica Kincaid's inspired, lyrical short stories<br><br>Reading Jamaica Kincaid is to plunge, gently, into another way of seeing both the physical world and its elusive inhabitants.  Her voice is, by turns, naively whimsical and biblical in its assurance, and it speaks of what is partially remembered partly divined.  The memories often concern a childhood in the Caribbean--family, manners, and landscape--as distilled and transformed by Kincaid's special style and vision.<br><br>Kincaid leads her readers to consider, as if for the first time, the powerful ties between mother and child; the beauty and destructiveness of nature; the gulf between the masculine and the feminine; the significance of familiar things--a house, a cup, a pen.  Transfiguring our human form and our surroundings--shedding skin, darkening an afternoon, painting a perfect place--these stories tell us something we didn't know, in a way we hadn't expected.<br>

In Shiloh, Bobbie Ann Mason introduces us to her western Kentucky people and the lives they forge for themselves amid the ups and downs of contemporary American life, and she poignantly captures the growing pains of the New South in the lives of her characters as they come to terms with feminism, R-rated movies, and video games. <br><br>\"Bobbie Ann Mason is one of those rare writers who, by concentrating their attention on a few square miles of native turf, are able to open up new and surprisingly wide worlds for the delighted reader,\" said Robert Towers in <i>The New York Review of Books</i>.<br>"

    - Donald Barthelme
    - With these audacious and murderously witty stories, Donald Barthelme threw the preoccupations of our time into the literary equivalent of a Cuisinart and served up a gorgeous salad of American culture, high and low. Here are the urban upheavals reimagined as frontier myth; travelogues through countries that might have been created by Kafka; cryptic dialogues that bore down to the bedrock of our longings, dreams, and angsts. Like all of Barthelme's work, the sixty stories collected in this volume are triumphs of language and perception, at once unsettling and irresistible.

    - Marilynne Robinson
    - A modern classic, <i>Housekeeping</i> is the story of Ruth and her younger sister, Lucille, who grow up haphazardly, first under the care of their competent grandmother, then of two comically bumbling great-aunts, and finally of Sylvie, their eccentric and remote aunt. The family house is in the small Far West town of Fingerbone set on a glacial lake, the same lake where their grandfather died in a spectacular train wreck, and their mother drove off a cliff to her death. It is a town "chastened by an outsized landscape and extravagant weather, and chastened again by an awareness that the whole of human history had occurred elsewhere." Ruth and Lucille's struggle toward adulthood beautifully illuminates the price of loss and survival, and the dangerous and deep undertow of transience.<br>

    - Book
    - Gilbert Sorrentino
    - A HUMOROUS AND HEARTFELT RE-CREATION OF A TIME AND A PLACE AS IT CAPTURES THE SADNESS AND VALUE OF FOUR LIVES Set at a boarding house in rural New Jersey in the summer of 1939, this novel revolves around four people who experience the comedies, torments and rare pleasures of family, romance and sex while on holiday from Brooklyn and the Depression. Billy Recco, an eager ten-year-old in search of a father; Marie Recco, nee McGrath, an attractive divorcee caught between her son and father, without a life of her own; John McGrath, dignified in manner yet brutally soured by life, insanely fearful of his daughter's restlessness; Tom Thebus, a rakish salesman who precipitates the conflict between Marie's hopes and her father's wrath. We follow these individuals through the events of thirty-six hours, culminating in Tom's disastrous near seduction of Marie. As the novel's perspective shifts to each of the four primary characters, four discrete stories take form, stories that Sorrentino further enriches by using a variety of literary methods - fantasies, letters, a narrative question-and-answer, fragments of dialogue and memory.  Strong and unforgettable, each voice is compelling in itself, yet in the end is only part of a complex, painful pattern in which dreams go unfulfilled and efforts unrewarded.

    - Sherman Alexie
    - "Fresh off his National Book Award win, Alexie delivers a heartbreaking, hilarious collection of stories that explores the precarious balance between self-preservation and external responsibility in art, family, and the world at large. With unparalleled insight into the minds of artists, laborers, fathers, husbands, and sons, Alexie populates his stories with ordinary men on the brink of exceptional change. In a bicoastal journey through the consequences of both simple and monumental life choices, Alexie introduces us to personal worlds as they transform beyond return. In the title story, a famous writer must decide how to care for his distant father who is slowly dying a \xE2\x80\x9Cnatural Indian death\xE2\x80\x9D from alcohol and diabetes, just as he learns that he himself may have a brain tumor.

    - "At San Francisco's acclaimed A16 restaurant (named for the highway that cuts across southern Italy), diners pack the house for chef Nate Appleman's house-cured salumi, textbook Naples-style pizzas, and gutsy slow-cooked meat dishes. Wine director Shelley Lindgren is renowned in the business for her expeditionary commitment to handcrafted southern Italian wines. In A16: FOOD + WINE, Appleman and Lindgren share the source of their inspiration--the bold flavors of Campania. From chile-spiked seafood stews and savory roasts to delicate antipasti and vegetable sides, the recipes are beguilingly rustic and approachable. Lindgren's vivid profiles of the key grapes and producers of southern Italy provide vital context for appreciating and pairing the wines. Stunning photography captures the wood-fired ambiance of the restaurant and the Campania countryside it celebrates."

    - "Rick Bayless's Mexican Kitchen: Capturing the Vibrant flavors of a World-Class Cuisine"
    - Book
    - Rick Bayless
    - "BURSTING WITH BOLD, COMPLEX FLAVORS, Mexican cooking has the kind of gusto we want in food today. Until now, American home cooks have had few authorities to translate the heart of this world-class cuisine to everyday cooking. <P> In this book of more than 150 recipes, award-winning chef, author and teacher Rick bayless provides  the inspiration and guidance that home cooks have needed. With a blend of passion, patience, clarity  and humor, he unerringly finds his way into the very soul of Mexican cuisine, from essential recipes and explorations of Mexico's many chiles to quick-to-prepare everyday dishes and pull-out-the-stops  celebration fare. <P> Bayless begins the journey by introducing us to the building blocks of Mexican cooking. With  infectious enthusiasm and an entertaining voice, he outlines 16 essential preparations-deeply  flavored tomato sauces and tangy tomatillo salsas, rich chile pastes and indispensable handmade  tortillas. <P> Fascinating cultural background and practical cooking tips help readers to understand these  preparations and make them their own. Each recipe explains which steps can be completed in advance to  make final preparation easier, and each provides a list of the dishes in later chapters that are  built around these basics. And with each essential recipe, Bayless includes several \"Simple Ideas  from My American Home\"-quick, familiar recipes with innovative Mexican accents, such as Baked Ham with Yucatecan Flavors, Spicy Chicken Salad, Ancho-Broiled Salmon and Very, Very Good Chili.  <P> Throughout, the intrepid Bayless brings chiles into focus, revealing that Mexican cooks use these  pods for flavor, richness, color and, yes, sometimes for heat. He details the simple techniques for getting the best out of every chile-from the rich, smoky chipotle to the incendiary but fruity habanero. <P> Then, in more than 135 recipes that follow, Bayless guides us through a wide range of richly flavored regional Mexican dishes, combining down-home appeal and convivial informality with simple culinary elegance. It's all here: starters like Classic Seviche Tostadas or Chorizo-Stuffed Ancho Chiles; soups like Slow-Simmered Fava Bean Soup or Rustic Ranch-Style Soup; casual tortilla-based preparations like Achiote-Roasted Pork Tacos or Street-Style Red Chile Enchiladas; vegetable delights like Smoky Braised Mexican Pumpkin, or Green Poblano Rice; even a whole chapter on classic fiesta food (from Oaxacan Black <I>Mole</I> with Braised Chicken, Smoky Peanut <I>Mole</I> with Grilled Quail and Great Big Tamal Roll with Chard with the incomparable Juchitan-Style Black Bean Tamales); and ending with a selection of luscious desserts like Modern Mexican Chocolate Flan with KahIua and Yucatecan-Style Fresh Coconut Pie. To quickly expand your Mexican repertoire even further, each of these recipes is accompanied by suggestions for variations and improvisations. <P> There is no greater authority on Mexican cooking than Rick Bayless, and no one can teach it better. In his skillful hands, the wonderful flavors of Mexico will enter your kitchen and your daily cooking routine without losing any of their depth or timeless appeal."

The land blessed by Heaven's table scraps was Georgia.    <P>Nestled in the Caucasus mountain range between the Black and  Caspian seas, the Republic of Georgia is as beautiful as it is  bountiful. The unique geography of the land, which includes both  alpine and subtropical zones, has created an enviable culinary  tradition.

Ms.  Goldstein describes the rugged  topography and turbulent history of this region that was once a  crossroad of trade between Asia and Europe. These cultural influences,  along with a healthy variety of food-producing environments, have led  to a rich native cuisine.\" --Anthony Dias Blue"

    - American Salvage (Made in Michigan Writers)
    - Book
    - Bonnie Jo Campbell
    - A lush and rowdy collection of stories set in a rural Michigan landscape, where wildlife, jobs, and ways of life are vanishing. New from award-winning Michigan writer Bonnie Jo Campbell, "American Salvage" is rich with local color and peopled with rural characters who love and hate extravagantly. They know how to fix cars and washing machines, how to shoot and clean game, and how to cook up methamphetamine, but they have not figured out how to prosper in the twenty-first century. Through the complex inner lives of working-class characters, Campbell illustrates the desperation of post-industrial America, where wildlife, jobs, and whole ways of life go extinct and the people have no choice but to live off what is left behind. The harsh Michigan winter is the backdrop for many of the tales, which are at turns sad, brutal, and oddly funny. One man prepares for the end of the world - scheduled for midnight December 31, 1999 - in a pole barn with chickens and survival manuals. An excruciating burn causes a man to transcend his racist and sexist world view. Another must decide what to do about his meth-addicted wife, who is shooting up on the other side of the bathroom door.

    - Daniyal Mueenuddin
    - "<strong>Finalist for the 2009 National Book Award in Fiction: \xE2\x80\x9CThe rural rootedness and gentle humour of R.K. Narayan with the literary sophistication and stylishness of Jhumpa Lahiri.\xE2\x80\x9D\xE2\x80\x94<em>Financial Times</em></strong>  Passing from the mannered drawing rooms of Pakistan\xE2\x80\x99s cities to the harsh mud villages beyond, Daniyal Mueenuddin\xE2\x80\x99s linked stories describe the interwoven lives of an aging feudal landowner, his servants and managers, and his extended family, industrialists who have lost touch with the land. In the spirit of Joyce\xE2\x80\x99s <em>Dubliners</em> and Turgenev\xE2\x80\x99s <em>A Sportsman\xE2\x80\x99s Sketches</em>, these stories comprehensively illuminate a world, describing members of parliament and farm workers, Islamabad society girls and desperate servant women. A hard-driven politician at the height of his powers falls critically ill and seeks to perpetuate his legacy; a girl from a declining Lahori family becomes a wealthy relative\xE2\x80\x99s mistress, thinking there will be no cost; an electrician confronts a violent assailant in order to protect his most valuable possession; a maidservant who advances herself through sexual favors unexpectedly falls in love. <br />  <br />  Together the stories in <em>In Other Rooms, Other Wonders</em> make up a vivid portrait of feudal Pakistan, describing the advantages and constraints of social station, the dissolution of old ways, and the shock of change. Refined, sensuous, by turn humorous, elegiac, and tragic, Mueenuddin evokes the complexities of the Pakistani feudal order as it is undermined and transformed. ."

    - Lark and Termite
    - Book
    - Jayne Anne Phillips
    - "A rich, wonderfully alive novel from one of our most admired and best-loved writers, her first book in nine years. <i>Lark and Termite </i>is set during the 1950s in West Virginia and Korea. It is a story of the power of loss and love, the echoing ramifications of war, family secrets, dreams and ghosts, and the unseen, almost magical bonds that unite and sustain us.<br><br>At its center, two children: Lark, on the verge of adulthood, and her brother, Termite, a child unable to walk and talk but filled with radiance. Around them, their mother, Lola, a haunting but absent presence; their aunt Nonie, a matronly, vibrant woman in her fifties, who raises them; and Termite\xE2\x80\x99s father, Corporal Robert Leavitt, who finds himself caught up in the chaotic early months of the Korean War.<br><br>Told with deep feeling, the novel invites us to enter into the hearts and thoughts of the leading characters, even into Termite\xE2\x80\x99s intricate, shuttered consciousness. We are with Leavitt, trapped by friendly fire alongside the Korean children he tries to rescue. We see Lark\xE2\x80\x99s dreams for Termite and her own future, and how, with the aid of a childhood love and a spectral social worker, she makes them happen. We learn of Lola\xE2\x80\x99s love for her soldier husband and her children, and unravel the mystery of her relationship with Nonie. We discover the lasting connections between past and future on the night the town experiences an overwhelming flood, and we follow Lark and Termite as their lives are changed forever."

    - Book
    - Orson Scott Card
    - Bean's past was a battle just to survive. He first appeared on the streets of Rotterdam, a tiny child with a mind leagues beyond anyone else. He knew he could not survive through strength; he used his tactical genius to gain acceptance into a children's gang, and then to help make that gang a template for success for all the others. He civilized them, and lived to grow older. Then he was discovered by the recruiters for the Battle School.<BR><BR>For Earth was at war -- a terrible war with an inscrutable alien enemy. A war that humanity was near to losing. But the long distances of interstellar space has given hope to the defenders of Earth -- they had time to train military geniuses up from childhood, forging them into an irresistible force in the high-orbital facility called the Battle School. That story is told in two books, the beloved classic Ender's Game, and its parallel, Ender's Shadow.<BR><BR>Bean was the smallest student at the Battle School, but he became Ender Wiggins' right hand. Since then he has grown to be a power on Earth. He served the Hegemon as strategist and general in the terrible wars that followed Ender's defeat of the alien empire attacking Earth. Now he and his wife Petra yearn for a safe place to build a family -- something he has never known -- but there is nowhere on Earth that does not harbor his enemies -- old enemies from the days in Ender's Jeesh, new enemies from the wars on Earth. To find security, Bean and Petra must once again follow in Ender's footsteps. They must leave Earth behind, in the control of the Hegemon, and look to the stars. (20050910)

    - Book
    - Drew Gilpin Faust
    - More than 600,000 soldiers lost their lives in the American Civil War. An equivalent proportion of today's population would be six million. In <b>This Republic of Suffering</b>, Drew Gilpin Faust reveals the ways that death on such a scale changed not only individual lives but the life of the nation, describing how the survivors managed on a practical level and how a deeply religious culture struggled to reconcile the unprecedented carnage with its belief in a benevolent God. Throughout, the voices of soldiers and their families, of statesmen, generals, preachers, poets, surgeons, nurses, northerners and southerners come together to give us a vivid understanding of the Civil War's most fundamental and widely shared reality.

    - Robert Weisbrot
    - <B>An engaging be hind-the-scenes look at the lesser-known forces that fueled the profound social reforms of the 1960s</B><BR><BR> Provocative and incisive , <I>The Liberal Hour</I> reveals how Washington, so often portrayed as a target of reform in the 1960s, was in fact the era's most effective engine of change. The movements of the 1960s have always drawn the most attention from the decade's chroniclers, but it was in the halls of government-so often the target of protesters' wrath-that the enduring reforms of the era were produced. With nuance and panache, Calvin Mackenzie and Robert Weisbrot present the real-life characters-from giants like JFK and Johnson to lesser-known senators and congressmen-who drove these reforms and were critical to the passage of key legislation. <I>The Liberal Hour</I> offers an engrossing portrait of this extraordinary moment when more progressive legislation was passed than in almost any other era in American history.

    - Book
    - Daniel Walker Howe
    - The Oxford History of the United States is by far the most respected multi-volume history of our nation. In this Pulitzer prize-winning, critically acclaimed addition to the series, historian Daniel Walker Howe illuminates the period from the battle of New Orleans to the end of the Mexican-American War, an era when the United States expanded to the Pacific and won control over the richest part of the North American continent. Howe's panoramic narrative portrays revolutionary improvements in transportation and communications that accelerated the extension of the American empire. Railroads, canals, newspapers, and the telegraph dramatically lowered travel times and spurred the spread of information. These innovations prompted the emergence of mass political parties and stimulated America's economic development from an overwhelmingly rural country to a diversified economy in which commerce and industry took their place alongside agriculture. In his story, the author weaves together political and military events with social, economic, and cultural history. He examines the rise of Andrew Jackson and his Democratic party, but contends that John Quincy Adams and other Whigs--advocates of public education and economic integration, defenders of the rights of Indians, women, and African-Americans--were the true prophets of America's future. He reveals the power of religion to shape many aspects of American life during this period, including slavery and antislavery, women's rights and other reform movements, politics, education, and literature. Howe's story of American expansion culminates in the bitterly controversial but brilliantly executed war waged against Mexico to gain California and Texas for the United States. <br>  <br>  Winner of the New-York Historical Society American History Book Prize<br>  <br>  Finalist, 2007 National Book Critics Circle Award for Nonfiction<br>

    - "Polio: An American Story"
    - Book
    - David M. Oshinsky
    - Here David Oshinsky tells the gripping story of the polio terror and of the intense effort to find a cure, from the March of Dimes to the discovery of the Salk and Sabin vaccines--and beyond.  Drawing on newly available papers of Jonas Salk, Albert Sabin and other key players, Oshinsky paints a suspenseful portrait of the race for the cure, weaving a dramatic tale centered on the furious rivalry between Salk and Sabin. He also tells the story of Isabel Morgan, perhaps the most talented of all polio researchers, who might have beaten Salk to the prize if she had not retired to raise a family.<br>    Oshinsky offers an insightful look at the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, which was founded in the 1930s by FDR and Basil O'Connor, it revolutionized fundraising and the perception of disease in America. Oshinsky also shows how the polio experience revolutionized the way in which the government licensed and tested new drugs before allowing them on the market, and the way in which the legal system dealt with manufacturers' liability for unsafe products. Finally, and perhaps most tellingly, Oshinsky reveals that polio was never the raging epidemic portrayed by the media, but in truth a relatively uncommon disease. But in baby-booming America--increasingly suburban, family-oriented, and hygiene-obsessed--the specter of polio, like the specter of the atomic bomb, soon became a cloud of terror over daily life. <br>     Both a gripping scientific suspense story and a provocative social and cultural history, Polio opens a fresh window onto postwar America.

    - Washington's Crossing (Pivotal Moments in American History)
    - Book
    - David Hackett Fischer
    - Six months after the Declaration of Independence, the American Revolution was all but lost. A powerful British force had routed the Americans at New York, occupied three colonies, and advanced within sight of Philadelphia. Yet, as David Hackett Fischer recounts in this riveting history, George Washington--and many other Americans--refused to let the Revolution die. On Christmas night, as a howling nor'easter struck the Delaware Valley, he led his men across the river and attacked the exhausted Hessian garrison at Trenton, killing or capturing nearly a thousand men. A second battle of Trenton followed within days. The Americans held off a counterattack by Lord Cornwallis's best troops, then were almost trapped by the British force. Under cover of night, Washington's men stole behind the enemy and struck them again, defeating a brigade at Princeton. The British were badly shaken. In twelve weeks of winter fighting, their army suffered severe damage, their hold on New Jersey was broken, and their strategy was ruined. Fischer's richly textured narrative reveals the crucial role of contingency in these events. We see how the campaign unfolded in a sequence of difficult choices by many actors, from generals to civilians, on both sides. While British and German forces remained rigid and hierarchical, Americans evolved an open and flexible system that was fundamental to their success. The startling success of Washington and his compatriots not only saved the faltering American Revolution, but helped to give it new meaning.

    - "A Nation under Our Feet: Black Political Struggles in the Rural South from Slavery to the Great Migration"
    - Book
    - Steven Hahn
    - <p>  This is the epic story of how African-Americans, in the six decades following slavery, transformed themselves into a political people--an embryonic black nation. As Steven Hahn demonstrates, rural African-Americans were central political actors in the great events of disunion, emancipation, and nation-building. At the same time, Hahn asks us to think in more expansive ways about the nature and boundaries of politics and political practice.  </p><p>  Emphasizing the importance of kinship, labor, and networks of communication, <i>A Nation under Our Feet</i> explores the political relations and sensibilities that developed under slavery and shows how they set the stage for grassroots mobilization. Hahn introduces us to local leaders, and shows how political communities were built, defended, and rebuilt. He also identifies the quest for self-governance as an essential goal of black politics across the rural South, from contests for local power during Reconstruction, to emigrationism, biracial electoral alliances, social separatism, and, eventually, migration.  </p><p>  Hahn suggests that Garveyism and other popular forms of black nationalism absorbed and elaborated these earlier struggles, thus linking the first generation of migrants to the urban North with those who remained in the South. He offers a new framework--looking out from slavery--to understand twentieth-century forms of black political consciousness as well as emerging battles for civil rights. It is a powerful story, told here for the first time, and one that presents both an inspiring and a troubling perspective on American democracy.  </p> (20031015)

    - Book
    - Rick Atkinson
    - "<B>In the first volume of his monumental trilogy about the liberation of Europe in WW II, Pulitzer Prize winner Rick Atkinson tells the riveting story of the war in North Africa<BR><BR></B>The liberation of Europe and the destruction of the Third Reich is a story of courage and enduring triumph, of calamity and miscalculation. In this first volume of the Liberation Trilogy, Rick Atkinson shows why no modern reader can understand the ultimate victory of the Allied powers without a grasp of the great drama that unfolded in North Africa in 1942 and 1943. That first year of the Allied war was a pivotal point in American history, the moment when the United States began to act like a great power.<BR><BR>Beginning with the daring amphibious invasion in November 1942, An Army at Dawn follows the American and British armies as they fight the French in Morocco and Algeria, and then take on the Germans and Italians in Tunisia. Battle by battle, an inexperienced and sometimes poorly led army gradually becomes a superb fighting force. Central to the tale are the extraordinary but fallible commanders who come to dominate the battlefield: Eisenhower, Patton, Bradley, Montgomery, and Rommel.<BR><BR>Brilliantly researched, rich with new material and vivid insights, Atkinson's narrative provides the definitive history of the war in North Africa."

    - "The Metaphysical Club: A Story of Ideas in America"
    - Book
    - Louis Menand
    - <b>Winner of the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for History</b><br><br><b>A riveting, original book about the creation of modern American thought.</b><br><br>The Metaphysical Club was an informal group that met in Cambridge, Massachusetts, in 1872, to talk about ideas. Its members included Oliver Well Holmes, Jr., future associate justice of the United States Supreme Court; William James, the father of modern American psychology; and Charles Sanders Peirce, logician, scientist, and the founder of semiotics. The Club was probably in existence for about nine months. No records were kept. The one thing we know that came out of it was an idea -- an idea about ideas. This book is the story of that idea.<br><br>Holmes, James, and Peirce all believed that ideas are not things "out there" waiting to be discovered but are tools people invent -- like knives and forks and microchips -- to make their way in the world. They thought that ideas are produced not by individuals, but by groups of individuals -- that ideas are social. They do not develop according to some inner logic of their own but are entirely depent -- like germs -- on their human carriers and environment. And they thought that the survival of any idea deps not on its immutability but on its adaptability.<br><br><i>The Metaphysical Club</i> is written in the spirit of this idea about ideas. It is not a history of philosophy but an absorbing narrative about personalities and social history, a story about America. It begins with the Civil War and s in 1919 with Justice Holmes's dissenting opinion in the case of U.S. v. Abrams-the basis for the constitutional law of free speech. The first four sections of the book focus on Holmes, James, Peirce, and their intellectual heir, John Dewey. The last section discusses some of the fundamental twentieth-century ideas they are associated with. This is a book about a way of thinking that changed American life."<br>

    - Book
    - David M. Kennedy
    - "Between 1929 and 1945, two great travails were visited upon the American people: the Great Depression and World War II. This book tells the story of how Americans endured, and eventually prevailed, in the face of those unprecedented calamities.<br>    The Depression was both a disaster and an opportunity. As David Kennedy vividly demonstrates, the economic crisis of the 1930s was far more than a simple reaction to the alleged excesses of the 1920s. For more than a century before 1929, America's unbridled industrial revolution had gyrated through repeated boom and bust cycles, wastefully consuming capital and inflicting untold misery on city and countryside alike.<br>    Freedom From Fear explores how the nation agonized over its role in World War II, how it fought the war, why the United States won, and why the consequences of victory were sometimes sweet, sometimes ironic. In a compelling narrative, Kennedy analyzes the determinants of American strategy, the painful choices faced by commanders and statesmen, and the agonies inflicted on the millions of ordinary Americans who were compelled to swallow their fears and face battle as best they could.<br>    Both comprehensive and colorful, this account of the most convulsive period in American history, excepting only the Civil War, reveals a period that formed the crucible in which modern America was formed. <br>  <br>  The Oxford History of the United States<br>  <br>  The Atlantic Monthly has praised The Oxford History of the United States as \"the most distinguished series in American historical scholarship,\" a series that \"synthesizes a generation's worth of historical inquiry and knowledge into one literally state-of-the-art book. Who touches these books touches a profession.\"<br>    Conceived under the general editorship of one of the leading American historians of our time, C. Vann Woodward, The Oxford History of the United States blends social, political, economic, cultural, diplomatic, and military history into coherent and vividly written narrative. Previous volumes are Robert Middlekauff's The Glorious Cause: The American Revolution; James M. McPherson's Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era (which won a Pulitzer Prize and was a New York Times Best Seller); and James T. Patterson's Grand Expectations: The United States 1945-1974 (which won a Bancroft Prize)."

    - Book
    - Edwin G. Burrows
    - To European explorers, it was Eden, a paradise of  waist-high grasses, towering stands of walnut, maple, chestnut, and  oak, and forests that teemed with bears, wolves, raccoons, beavers,  otters, and foxes. Today, it is the site of Broadway and Wall Street,  the Empire State Building and the Statue of Liberty, and the home of  millions of people, who have come from every corner of the nation and  the globe.    <P>In Gotham, Edwin G. Burrows and Mike Wallace have produced a  monumental work of history, one that ranges from the Indian tribes  that settled in and around the island of Manna-hata, to the  consolidation of the five boroughs into Greater New York in 1898. It  is an epic narrative, a story as vast and as varied as the city it  chronicles, and it underscores that the history of New York is the  story of our nation. Readers will relive the tumultuous early years of  New Amsterdam under the Dutch West India Company, Peter Stuyvesant's  despotic regime, Indian wars, slave resistance and revolt, the  Revolutionary War and the defeat of Washington's army on Brooklyn  Heights, the destructive seven years of British occupation, New York  as the nation's first capital, the duel between Aaron Burr and  Alexander Hamilton, the Erie Canal and the coming of the railroads,  the growth of the city as a port and financial center, the infamous  draft riots of the Civil War, the great flood of immigrants, the rise  of mass entertainment such as vaudeville and Coney Island, the  building of the Brooklyn Bridge and the birth of the skyscraper. Here  too is a cast of thousands--the rebel Jacob Leisler and the reformer  Joanna Bethune; Clement Moore, who saved Greenwich Village from the  city's street-grid plan; Herman Melville, who painted disillusioned  portraits of city life; and Walt Whitman, who happily celebrated that  same life. We meet the rebel Jacob Leisler and the reformer Joanna  Bethune; Boss Tweed and his nemesis, cartoonist Thomas Nast; Emma  Goldman and Nellie Bly; Jacob Riis and Horace Greeley; police  commissioner Theodore Roosevelt; Colonel Waring and his "white angels"  (who revolutionized the sanitation department); millionaires John  Jacob Astor, Cornelius Vanderbilt, August Belmont, and William  Randolph Hearst; and hundreds more who left their mark on this great  city.    <P>The events and people who crowd these pages guarantee that this is no  mere local history. It is in fact a portrait of the heart and soul of  America, and a book that will mesmerize everyone interested in the  peaks and valleys of American life as found in the greatest city on  earth. Gotham is a dazzling read, a fast-paced, brilliant narrative  that carries the reader along as it threads hundreds of stories into  one great blockbuster of a book.

    - Edward J. Larson
    - "Reissued with a new preface: the Pulitzer Prize-winning book   that is \"quite simply the best book ever written on the Scopes Trial and   its place in American history and myth.\" <P>  In the summer of 1925, the sleepy hamlet of Dayton, Tennessee, became the   setting for one of the 20th century's most contentious dramas:  the Scopes   trial that pit William Jennings Bryan and the anti-Darwinists against a   teacher named John Scopes into a famous debate over science, religion, and   their place in public education. <P>  That trial marked the start of a battle that continues to this day--in   Dover, Pennsylvania, Kansas, Cobb County, Georgia, and many other cities   and states throughout the country.  Edward Larson's classic, <I>Summer for   the Gods</I>, received the Pulitzer Prize in History in 1998 and is the   single most authoritative account of a pivotal event whose combatants   remain at odds in school districts and courtrooms.  For this edition,   Larson has added a new preface that assesses the state of the battle   between creationism and evolution, and points the way to how it might   potentially be resolved."

    - "A gripping, groundbreaking biography of the combative man whose genius and force of will created modern capitalism.<br><br>Founder of a dynasty, builder of the original Grand Central, creator of an impossibly vast fortune, Cornelius \xE2\x80\x9CCommodore\xE2\x80\x9D Vanderbilt is an American icon. Humbly born on Staten Island during George Washington\xE2\x80\x99s presidency, he rose from boatman to builder of the nation\xE2\x80\x99s largest fleet of steamships to lord of a railroad empire. Lincoln consulted him on steamship strategy during the Civil War; Jay Gould was first his uneasy ally and then sworn enemy; and Victoria Woodhull, the first woman to run for president of the United States, was his spiritual counselor. We see Vanderbilt help to launch the transportation revolution, propel the Gold Rush, reshape Manhattan, and invent the modern corporation\xE2\x80\x94in fact, as T. J. Stiles elegantly argues, Vanderbilt did more than perhaps any other individual to create the economic world we live in today.<br><br>In <i>The First Tycoon</i>, Stiles offers the first complete, authoritative biography of this titan, and the first comprehensive account of the Commodore\xE2\x80\x99s personal life. It is a sweeping, fast-moving epic, and a complex portrait of the great man. Vanderbilt, Stiles shows, embraced the philosophy of the Jacksonian Democrats and withstood attacks by his conservative enemies for being too competitive. He was a visionary who pioneered business models. He was an unschooled fistfighter who came to command the respect of New York\xE2\x80\x99s social elite. And he was a father who struggled with a gambling-addicted son, a husband who was loving yet abusive, and, finally, an old man who was obsessed with contacting the dead.<br><br><i>The First Tycoon</i> is the exhilarating story of a man and a nation maturing together: the powerful account of a man whose life was as epic and complex as American history itself.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

    - "The Fate of Liberty: Abraham Lincoln and Civil Liberties"
    - Book
    - Mark E. Neely Jr.
    - "If Abraham Lincoln was known as the Great Emancipator, he was also the only president to suspend the writ of habeas corpus.  Indeed, Lincoln's record on the Constitution and individual rights has fueled a century of debate, from charges that Democrats were singled out for harrassment to Gore Vidal's depiction of Lincoln as an \"absolute dictator.\" Now, in the Pulitzer Prize-winning The Fate of Liberty, one of America's leading authorities on Lincoln wades straight into this controversy, showing just who was jailed and why, even as he explores the whole range of Lincoln's constitutional policies.    <P>Mark Neely depicts Lincoln's suspension of habeas corpus as a well-intentioned attempt to deal with a floodtide of unforeseen events: the threat to Washington as Maryland flirted with secession, disintegrating public order in the border states, corruption among military contractors, the occupation of hostile Confederate territory, contraband trade with the South, and the outcry against the first draft in U.S. history.  Drawing on letters from prisoners, records of military courts and federal prisons, memoirs, and federal archives, he paints a vivid picture of how Lincoln responded to these problems, how his policies were actually executed, and the virulent political debates that followed.  Lincoln emerges from this account with this legendary statesmanship intact--mindful of political realities and prone to temper the sentences of military courts, concerned not with persecuting his opponents but with prosecuting the war efficiently.  In addition, Neely explores the abuses of power under the regime of martial law: the routine torture of suspected deserters, widespread antisemitism among Union generals and officials, the common practice of seizing civilian hostages.  He finds that though the system of military justice was flawed, it suffered less from merciless zeal, or political partisanship, than from inefficiency and the friction and complexities of modern war.    <P>Informed by a deep understanding of a unique period in American history, this incisive book takes a comprehensive look at the issues of civil liberties during Lincoln's administration, placing them firmly in the political context of the time.  Written with keen insight and an intimate grasp of the original sources, The Fate of Liberty offers a vivid picture of the crises and chaos of a nation at war with itself, changing our understanding of this president and his most controversial policies."

    - Book
    - James M. McPherson
    - Now featuring a new Afterword by the author, this handy paperback edition of the Pulitzer Prize-winning Battle Cry of Freedom is without question the definitive one-volume history of the Civil War. James McPherson's fast-paced narrative fully integrates the political, social, and military events that crowded the two decades from the outbreak of one war in Mexico to the ending of another at Appomattox. Packed with drama and analytical insight, the book vividly recounts the momentous episodes that preceded the Civil War including the Dred Scott decision, the Lincoln-Douglas debates, John Brown's raid on Harper's Ferry. From there it moves into a masterful chronicle of the war itself--the battles, the strategic maneuvering by each side, the politics, and the personalities. Particularly notable are McPherson's new views on such matters as the slavery expansion issue in the 1850s, the origins of the Republican Party, the causes of secession, internal dissent and anti-war opposition in the North and the South, and the reasons for the Union's victory. The book's title refers to the sentiments that informed both the Northern and Southern views of the conflict. The South seceded in the name of that freedom of self-determination and self-government for which their fathers had fought in 1776, while the North stood fast in defense of the Union founded by those fathers as the bulwark of American liberty. Eventually, the North had to grapple with the underlying cause of the war, slavery, and adopt a policy of emancipation as a second war aim. This "new birth of freedom," as Lincoln called it, constitutes the proudest legacy of America's bloodiest conflict. This authoritative volume makes sense of that vast and confusing "second American Revolution" we call the Civil War, a war that transformed a nation and expanded our heritage of liberty.

    - Book
    - the Late Don E. Fehrenbacher
    - "Winner of the Pulitzer Prize in 1979, The Dred Scott Case is a masterful examination of the most famous example of judicial failure--the case referred to as \"the most frequently overturned decision in history.\"<br>    On March 6, 1857, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney delivered the Supreme Court's decision against Dred Scott, a slave who maintained he had been emancipated as a result of having lived with his master in the free state of Illinois and in federal territory where slavery was forbidden by the Missouri Compromise. The decision did much more than resolve the fate of an elderly black man and his family: Dred Scott v. Sanford was the first instance in which the Supreme Court invalidated a major piece of federal legislation. The decision declared that Congress had no power to prohibit slavery in the federal territories, thereby striking a severe blow at the legitimacy of the emerging Republican party and intensifying the sectional conflict over slavery.<br>    This book represents a skillful review of the issues before America on the eve of the Civil War. The first third of the book deals directly with the with the case itself and the Court's decision, while the remainder puts the legal and judicial question of slavery into the broadest possible American context. Fehrenbacher discusses the legal bases of slavery, the debate over the Constitution, and the dispute over slavery and continental expansion. He also considers the immediate and long-range consequences of the decision."

    - Alfred D. Chandler Jr.
    - "<p>  The role of large-scale business enterprise--big business and its managers--during the formative years of modern capitalism (from the 1850s until the 1920s is delineated in this pathmarking book. Alfred Chandler, Jr., the distinguished business historian, sets forth the reasons for the dominance of big business in American transportation, communications, and the central sectors of production and distribution.  </p><p>  The managerial revolution, presented here with force and conviction, is the story of how the visible hand of management replaced what Adam Smith called the invisible hand of market forces. Chandler shows that the fundamental shift toward managers running large enterprises exerted a far greater influence in determining size and concentration in American industry than other factors so often cited as critical: the quality of entrepreneurship, the availability of capital, or public policy.  </p>"

    - Jefferson and His Time
    - Book
    - Dumas Malone
    - Dumas Malone's classic biography "Jefferson and His Time" - originally published in six volumes over a period of thirty-four years, between 1948 and 1982 - was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in history and became the standard work on Jefferson's life. The University of Virginia Press is pleased to announce that the complete, illustrated six-volume biography is available for the first time in a handsome boxed set. Merrill Peterson, editor of the Library of America edition of Thomas Jefferson's writings, has contributed a new foreword to the Virginia edition. Volume 1, "Jefferson the Virginian" - This first volume explores the early phases of Jefferson's life, from his youth, education, legal career, and marriage, to the building of Monticello, writing of the Declaration of Independence and his highly contentious governorship. Volume 2, "Jefferson and the Rights of Man" - "Jefferson and the Rights of Man is better, even, than its predecessor, and that is saying a great deal. What I like particularly is that Malone...has by some great miracle, achieved something of Jefferson's own combination of profundity and erudition and gracefulness." - Henry Steele Commager.  In this second volume, Malone recounts the eventful middle years of Jefferson's life, beginning with the European mission and Jefferson's ministry to France and continuing through his role in the French revolution and his memorable service as secretary of state in the first cabinet of George Washington. Volume 3, "Jefferson and the Ordeal of Liberty" - "Not only has Mr. Malone mastered the vast body of Jefferson's correspondence and the writings of his contemporaries, but he has fully explored the wealth of monographic material devoted to this epoch...Throughout the book there is a sense of proportion and balance which might well be called classic." - Harry Ammon, "Virginia Magazine". Beginning with Jefferson's final year of service as secretary of state in Washington's cabinet, this volume takes on one of the most significant and controversial years in Jefferson's life and indeed in modern Western history, while also exploring Jefferson's retirement to Monticello, his decision to lead the opposition party, and his own election as president in 1801.  Volume 4, "Jefferson the President; First Term, 1801-1805" - "Without question, this volume, rich in detail, perceptive and sensitive in analysis, and remarkably fair with the principal partisans, will be read for generations to come." - "Chicago Tribune." Examining the first four years of Jefferson's presidency, this volume provides a fascinating account of the Louisiana Purchase, Jefferson's continuing opposition to Hamilton's charge for an overriding central government, and his battle with the Supreme Court. Volume 5, "Jefferson the President; Second Term, 1805-1809" - "[Malone] holds Jefferson to a high level of integrity, and when he catches the Virginian in some act that does not accord with his ideal of rectitude, he suffers visible distress - perhaps more than did Jefferson himself." - "New York Times". Covering the climax of Jefferson's forty-year career, this fifth and penultimate volume follows Jefferson through his demanding second term as president, when he famously sponsors the Lewis and Clark expedition, confronts the trial of Aaron Burr, and concludes the naval "war" with the Barbary pirates.  Volume 6, "The Sage of Monticello" - "[W]ith splendid insight and artistry, Professor Dumas Malone has reconstructed the world through which Jefferson passed, and preserved and presented to us a complex and engaging Jefferson, in a masterpiece of humanistic scholarship." National Endowment for the Humanities, The Chairman's Citation, presented to Dumas Malone April 30, 1979. This final volume provides an all-encompassing account of Jefferson's accomplishments, friendships, and family difficulties in his last seventeen years, revealing his shift from the realm of politics to his roles as family man, architect, and educational enthusiast. Describing Jefferson's retirement from Washington, this volume recounts the events that formed Jefferson's final years, particularly the founding of the Library of Congress and the University of Virginia.

    - The Ideological Origins of the American Revolution
    - Book
    - Bernard Bailyn
    - In this 25th anniversary edition, Bailyn has added a substantial essay, "Fulfillment", as a Postscript to the original text. In it he discusses the intense, nation-wide debate on the ratification of the constitution, stressing the continuities between that struggle over the foundations of the national government and the original principles of the Revolution. This study of the persistence of the nation's ideological origins adds a new dimension to the book and projects its meaning forward into vital present concerns. Bailyn is author of "The Ordeal of Thomas Hutchinson" which won the National Book Award and "Voyagers to the West" which won the Pulitzer Prize for History.

    - "The Uprooted: The Epic Story of the Great Migrations That Made the American People"
    - Book
    - Oscar Handlin
    - <p>Awarded the 1952 Pulitzer Prize in history, <i>The Uprooted</i> chronicles the common experiences of the millions of European immigrants who came to America in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries--their fears, their hopes, their expectations. The <i>New Yorker</i> called it "strong stuff, handled in a masterly and quite moving way," while the <i>New York Times </i>suggested that "<i>The Uprooted</i> is history with a difference--the difference being its concerns with hearts and souls no less than an event."<br /><br />The book inspired a generation of research in the history of American immigration, but because it emphasizes the depressing conditions faced by immigrants, focuses almost entirely on European peasants, and does not claim to provide a definitive answer to the causes of American immigration, its great value as a well-researched and readable description of the emotional experiences of immigrants, and its ability to evoke the time and place of America at the turn of a century, have sometimes been overlooked. Recognized today as a foundational text in immigration studies, this edition contains a new preface by the author.</p>

    - Across the Wide Missouri
    - Book
    - Bernard DeVoto
    - Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the Bancroft Prize. Across the Wide Missouri tells the compelling story of the climax and decline of the Rocky Mountain fur trade during the 1830s.

    - The Road To Reunion 1865-1900
    - Book
    - Paul H. Buck
    - THE ROAD TO REUNION THE ROAD TO REUNION 1865 - IpOO BY PAUL H. BUCK LITTLE, BHOWN AND COMPANY BOSTON TORONTO PREFACE WHEN the colors of the Confederacy were furled in sur render at Appomattox the United States confronted a prob lem new to American statecraft. For the first time in its his tory the country was called upon to deal with a disaffected people who had aspired to independence and failed. The situa tion was a perplexing one. The restored Union rested frankly upon force. The North was arrogant in victory and inclined to be assertive in the realization of newly found power. The South lay spent and exhausted, yet ready to offer stolid re sistance to the unfriendly gestures of its assailant. Certainly he who essayed to rejoin the disrupted fabric of national life would learn in full measure how strong and unyielding is the hatred of brothers. Victors in a civil strife are prone to consider themselves as constituting the nation. The defeated tend as readily to resent the implied inferiority of their humiliating position. The misunderstanding of the Reconstruction period arose nat urally from these conditions. For twelve years the North en deavored to build a policy upon force. The South in resistance rejected good and bad indiscriminately. In the process the sectional division persisted and perhaps intensified. And yet the central theme of American life after the war, even in the years of political radicalism, is not to be found in a narrative of sectional divergence. It was national integra tion which triumphed at Appomattox. It was national integra tion which marked every important development in the years that followed. The period of Reconstruction, as usually defined, it is true, gave rise to an abnormal political condition which in its divisive influence ran counter to the basic theme. But viii PREFACE political Reconstruction was not fundamental. Seemingly re gardless of the political clamor that so filled the public ear, the formation of American character continued. The sturdy barriers of sectional antipathy and distrust crumbled one by one. Not all the misunderstanding disappeared. And certainly as should be expected the normal differences in economic and sociological regionalism persisted and will persist. But within a generation after the close of the Civil War the particular istic aspirations of North and South had lost their bitter edge and an American nationalism existed which derived its ele ments indiscriminately from both the erstwhile foes. A union of sentiment based upon integrated interests had become a fact. This speedy reconciliation was a striking illustration of the dynamic force exerted by nationalism in the Nineteenth Cen tury. There had been a distinctive American character as early as dwellers in a new world had interests and ways of looking at things peculiar to themselves. It had developed rapidly in the common work of the Revolution until the Constitution of 1787 gave it perfected form by establishing an effective central government. But no sooner had the early republic entered upon its career than the bases of national life shifted pro foundly. The energies of new forces found an easy lodgment in the fluid state of an unformed society and made of America a laboratory of contending currents. In time the pattern of a new and stronger nationalism emerged. It was in the North that the potent influence of this new agency was first introduced...

    - Book
    - Robert Dallek
    - "<p> Working side by side in the White House, Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger were two of the most compelling, contradictory, and powerful figures in America in the second half of the twentieth century. While their personalities could hardly have seemed more different, both were largely self-made men, brimming with ambition, driven by their own inner demons, and often ruthless in pursuit of their goals. </p> <p> Tapping into a wealth of recently declassified archives, Robert Dallek uncovers fascinating details about Nixon and Kissinger's tumultuous personal relationship and brilliantly analyzes their shared roles in monumental historical events\xE2\x80\x94including the nightmare of Vietnam, the unprecedented opening to China, d\xC3\xA9tente with the Soviet Union, the Yom Kippur War in the Middle East, the disastrous overthrow of Allende in Chile, and the scandal of Watergate. </p>"

    - "The Coldest Winter: America and the Korean War"
    - Book
    - David Halberstam
    - "David Halberstam's magisterial and thrilling The Best and the Brightest was the defining book for the Vietnam War. More than three decades later, Halberstam used his unrivalled research and formidable journalistic skills to shed light on another dark corner in our history: the Korean War. The Coldest Winter is a successor to The Best and the Brightest, even though in historical terms it precedes it.Halberstam considered The Coldest Winter the best book he ever wrote, the culmination of forty-five years of writing about America's postwar foreign policy.Up until now, the Korean War has been the black hole of modern American history.The Coldest Winter changes that. Halberstam gives us a masterful narrative of the political decisions and miscalculations on both sides. He charts the disastrous path that led to the massive entry of Chinese forces near the Yalu, and that caught Douglas MacArthur and his soldiers by surprise. He provides astonishingly vivid and nuanced portraits of all the major figures -- Eisenhower, Truman, Acheson, Kim, and Mao, and Generals MacArthur, Almond, and Ridgway. At the same time, Halberstam provides us with his trademark highly evocative narrative journalism, chronicling the crucial battles with reportage of the highest order.At the heart of the book are the individual stories of the soldiers on the front lines who were left to deal with the consequences of the dangerous misjudgments and competing agendas of powerful men. We meet them, follow them, and see some of the most dreadful battles in history through their eyes. As ever, Halberstam was concerned with the extraordinary courage and resolve of people asked to bear an extraordinary burden.The Coldest Winter is contemporary history in its most literary and luminescent form, and provides crucial perspective on the Vietnam War and the events of today. It was a book that Halberstam first decided to write more than thirty years ago and that took him nearly ten years to write. It stands as a lasting testament to one of the greatest journalists and historians of our time, and to the fighting men whose heroism it chronicles.Includes an Afterword by Russell BakerTributes to David HalberstamDavid Halberstam died at the age of 73 in a car accident in California on April 23, 2007, just after completing The Coldest Winter. Legendary for his work ethic, his kindness to young writers, and his unbending moral spine, Halberstam had friends and admirers throughout journalism, many of whom spoke at his memorial service and at readings across the country for the release of The Coldest Winter. We have included testimonials given at his memorial service by two writers who made their reputations at the same newspaper where he won a Pulitzer Prize for his Vietnam War reporting, The New York Times: Anna Quindlen ...David occupied a lot of space on the planet. Perhaps he felt the price he must pay for that big voice, that big reach, that big reputation, was that his generosity had to be just as large. Most of us, when we take to the road and meet admiring strangers, vow afterward to answer the note pressed into our hands or to pass along the speech we promised to the person whose daughter couldn't be there to hear it. But with the best will in the world we arrive home to deadlines, bills, kids, friends, all the demands of a busy life. We mean to be our best selves, but often we forget. David did it. He always did it. The note, the call, the book, the advice. When I mentioned this once he dug his hands deep intothe pockets of his grey flannels, set his mouth at the corners, looked down and rumbled, \"Well, but it's so easy.\" That's nonsense. It's not easy. But it is important, and why he has been remembered with enormous affection by ordinary readers all over this country, and why each of us who live some sort of public life would do well, with all due respect to Jesus, to ask ourselves about those small encounters: what would David do? ...

    - Book
    - Jill Lepore
    - <b>Pulitzer Prize Finalist</b><br><b>Anisfield-Wolf Award Winner</b><br><br>Over a frigid few weeks in the winter of 1741, ten fires blazed across Manhattan. With each new fire, panicked whites saw more evidence of a slave uprising. In the end, thirteen black men were burned at the stake, seventeen were hanged and more than one hundred black men and women were thrown into a dungeon beneath City Hall. <br><br>In <i>New York Burning</i>,<i> </i>Bancroft Prize-winning historian Jill Lepore recounts these dramatic events, re-creating, with path-breaking research, the nascent New York of the seventeenth century. Even then, the city was a rich mosaic of cultures, communities and colors, with slaves making up a full one-fifth of the population.  Exploring the political and social climate of the times, Lepore dramatically shows how, in a city rife with state intrigue and terror, the threat of black rebellion united the white political pluralities in a frenzy of racial fear and violence.

    - Book
    - Michael O'Brien
    - In this magisterial history of intellectual life, Michael O'Brien analyzes the lives and works of antebellum Southern thinkers and reintegrates the South into the larger tradition of American and European intellectual history. <p>O'Brien finds that the evolution of Southern intellectual life paralleled and modified developments across the Atlantic by moving from a late Enlightenment sensibility to Romanticism and, lastly, to an early form of realism. Volume 1 describes the social underpinnings of the Southern intellect by examining patterns of travel and migration; the formation of ideas on race, gender, ethnicity, locality, and class; and the structures of discourse, expressed in manuscripts and print culture.  In Volume 2, O'Brien looks at the genres that became characteristic of Southern thought. Throughout, he pays careful attention to the many individuals who fashioned the Southern mind, including John C. Calhoun, Louisa McCord, James Henley Thornwell, and George Fitzhugh. <p>Placing the South in the larger tradition of American and European intellectual history while recovering the contributions of numerous influential thinkers and writers, O'Brien's masterwork demonstrates the sophistication and complexity of Southern intellectual life before 1860.

To understand what happens to the people in these interconnected stories is to understand America's anguish. Based on thousands of primary documents and 180 on-the-record interviews, the book describes the battles that evoked cultural and political conflicts that still reverberate."

    - Book
    - Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz
    - "From bawdy talk to evangelical sermons, and from celebrations of free love to prosecutions for obscenity, nineteenth-century America encompassed a far broader range of sexual attitudes and ideas than the Victorian stereotype would have us believe. In <b>Rereading Sex</b>, Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz lets us listen to the national conversation about sex in the nineteenth century and hear voices that resonate in our own time.<br><br>Probing court records, pamphlets, and \xE2\x80\x9Csporting men\xE2\x80\x99s\xE2\x80\x9D magazines, Horowitz shows us a many-voiced America in which an earthy acceptance of desire and sexual expression collided with prohibitions broadcast from the pulpit.  We encounter fascinating reformers like Victoria Woodhull, who advocated free love and became the first woman to run for president; faddists like Sylvester Graham, who obsessed about the dangers of masturbation; and moral crusaders like Anthony Comstock, who succeeded in banning sexual subject matter from the mails.  We also see how newspapers like the <i>Sunday Flash</i> treated prostitutes like celebrities and how the <i>National Police Gazette </i>found a legal way to write about explicity about sex through crime reports that read like gossip columns. Employing an encyclopedic knowledge artfully rendered, Horowitz brings to the fore a wide spectrum of attitudes and a debate echoed in the culture wars of today."

    - "Deep Souths: Delta, Piedmont, and Sea Island Society in the Age of Segregation"
    - Book
    - J. William Harris
    - "<I>Deep Souths</I> tells the stories of three southern regions from  Reconstruction to World War II: the Mississippi-Yazoo Delta, the eastern Piedmont of Georgia,  and the Georgia Sea Islands and Atlantic coast. Though these regions initially shared the histories  and populations we associate with the idea of a \"Deep South\"--all had economies based on slave  plantation labor in 1860--their histories diverged sharply during the three generations after  Reconstruction. With research gathered from oral histories, census reports, and a wide variety of  other sources, Harris traces these regional changes in cumulative stories of individuals across the  social spectrum. <I>Deep Souths</I> presents a comparative and ground-level view of history  that challenges the idea that the lower South was either uniform or static in the era of  segregation. By the end of the New Deal era, changes in these regions had prepared the way for  the civil rights movement and the end of segregation."

    - "Facing East from Indian Country: A Native History of Early America"
    - Book
    - Dr. Daniel K. Richter
    - In the beginning, North America was Indian country. But only in the beginning. After the opening act of the great national drama, Native Americans yielded to the westward rush of European settlers.  </p><p>  Or so the story usually goes. Yet, for three centuries after Columbus, Native people controlled most of eastern North America and profoundly shaped its destiny. In <i>Facing East from Indian Country</i>, Daniel K. Richter keeps Native people center-stage throughout the story of the origins of the United States.  </p><p>  Viewed from Indian country, the sixteenth century was an era in which Native people discovered Europeans and struggled to make sense of a new world. Well into the seventeenth century, the most profound challenges to Indian life came less from the arrival of a relative handful of European colonists than from the biological, economic, and environmental forces the newcomers unleashed. Drawing upon their own traditions, Indian communities reinvented themselves and carved out a place in a world dominated by transatlantic European empires. In 1776, however, when some of Britain's colonists rebelled against that imperial world, they overturned the system that had made Euro-American and Native coexistence possible. Eastern North America only ceased to be an Indian country because the revolutionaries denied the continent's first peoples a place in the nation they were creating.  </p><p>  In rediscovering early America as Indian country, Richter employs the historian's craft to challenge cherished assumptions about times and places we thought we knew well, revealing Native American experiences at the core of the nation's birth and identity.

    - Book
    - Frances FitzGerald
    - <P>  Using the Star Wars missile defense program as a magnifying glass on his presidency, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Frances FitzGerald gives us a wholly original portrait of Ronald Reagan. Drawing on extensive research, FitzGerald shows how Reagan managed to get billions in funding for a program that was technologically impossible by exploiting the fears of the American public. The Reagan who emerges from FitzGerald's book was a gifted politician with a deep understanding of the national psyche, and an executive almost totally disengaged from the policies of his administration. Both appalling and funny, <I>Way Out There in the Blue</I> is the most penetrating study of Reagan's presidency to date.

    - Book
    - Alexander Keyssar
    - "An esteemed historian offers a compelling re-thinking of the path America has taken toward its goal of universal suffrage    <P>Most Americans take for granted their right to vote, whether they choose to exercise it or not. But the history of suffrage in the U.S. is, in fact,the story of a struggle to achieve this right by our society's marginalized groups. In The Right to Vote, Duke historian Alexander Keyssar explores the evolution of suffrage over the course of the nation's history. Examining the many features of the history of the right to vote in the U.S.-class, ethnicity, race, gender, religion, and age-the book explores the conditions under which American democracy has expanded and contracted over the years.    <P>Keyssar presents convincing evidence that the history of the right to vote has not been one of a steady history of expansion and increasing inclusion, noting that voting rights contracted substantially in the U.S. between 1850 and 1920. Keyssar also presents a controversial thesis: that the primary factor promoting the expansion of the suffrage has been war and the primary factors promoting contraction or delaying expansion have been class tension and class conflict."

    - Book
    - James H. Merrell
    - An award-winning historian's beautifully written   reconstruction of how Europeans lived in peace and war with Indians on   the early American frontier. We know them from Conrad, Greene, and Le   Carre, as spies, diplomats, renegades, and traders. They've been with us   since the mythic past, when Hermes carried messages from the gods to the   Greeks, and when Deganawidah with his disciple Hiawatha built the Great   League of Peace among the Iroquois. They are the go-betweens, the shadowy   figures who move between us and them, linking different worlds. On the   Pennsylvania frontier they were Germans and Irish, Delawares and   Iroquois, with names like Weiser, Croghan, Shickellamy, and Osternados.   These were the "wood's men," at home in the woods, knowledgeable in the   ways of the other, able to negotiate the thickets of cultural   misunderstanding and mistrust. From the Quaker colony's founding in the   early 1680s into the mid-1750s, they did the hard, dirty work that helped   maintain the fragile "long peace" between Indians and colonists. But   skilled as they were they could not prevent the colony's sickening   plummet from peace to war after 1750. The harsh lesson of the woods was   the final incompatibility of colonial and native dreams about the   continent they shared.

    - "The Cousins' Wars: Religion, Politics, Civil Warfare, And The Triumph Of Anglo-America"
    - Book
    - Kevin Phillips
    - "A strikingly fresh and revisionist explanation for the  rise of Anglo-America as the dominant cultural and political force in  the world today by the bestselling author of <I>The Politics of Rich and  Poor</I>.    <P>The question at the heart of <I>The Cousins' Wars</I> is this: How did  Anglo-America evolve over a mere three hundred years from a small  Tudor kingdom into a global community with such a hegemonic grip on  the world today, while no other European power-Spain, France, Germany,  or Russia-did? The answer to this, according to Phillips, lies in a  close examination of three internecine English-speaking civil wars-the  English Civil War, the American Revolution, and the American Civil  War. These wars between cousins functioned as crucial anvils on which  various religious, ethnic, and political alliances were hammered out  between the English-speaking cousin-nations, setting them on a unique  two-track path toward world leadership-one aristocratic and aloof to  dominate the imperial nineteenth century and the other more  egalitarian and democratic to take over in the twentieth century. They  also functioned as unfortunate and deadly cultural crucibles for  African Americans, Native Americans, and the Irish.    <P>Phillips's analysis shows exactly how these conflicts are inextricably  linked and how they seeded each other. He offers often surprising  interpretations that cut across the political spectrum-for instance,  that the Constitution of the United States, while brilliant in many  respects, was also a fatally flawed political compromise that  contributed mightily in setting the stage for the final-and the  bloodiest-cousins' war: the American Civil War.    <P>With the new millennium upon us and triggering widespread assessment  of our nation's place in world history, <I>The Cousins' Wars</i>  provides just the kind of magisterial sweep and revisionist spark to  ignite widespread interest and debate. This grand religious, military,  and political epic is the multi-dimensional story of the triumph of  Anglo-America."

In a dazzling synthesis of the latest research with masterful storytelling, Marks portrays the systematic dispossession of America's original inhabitants over centuries of broken promises and bloody persecutions. Well-known events and personalities -- the Battle of Little Big Horn, the Trail of Tears, Geronimo, to name a few -- are juxtaposed with lesser-known but equally pivotal episodes such as the Navajos' Long Walk, the Snake Indian resistance, and more.</p>

    - Hailed as "toweringly important" (Baltimore <I>Sun</I>), "a work of scrupulous and significant reportage" (E. L. Doctorow), and "an unforgettable historical drama" <I>(Chicago Sun-Times), Big Trouble</I> brings to life the astonishing case that ultimately engaged President Theodore Roosevelt, Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell Holmes, and the politics and passions of an entire nation at century's turn.  <P>  After Idaho's former governor is blown up by a bomb at his garden gate at Christmastime 1905, America's most celebrated detective, Pinkerton James McParland, takes over the investigation. His daringly executed plan to kidnap the radical union leader "Big Bill" Haywood from Colorado to stand trial in Idaho sets the stage for a memorable courtroom confrontation between the flamboyant prosecutor, progressive senator William Borah, and the young defender of the dispossessed, Clarence Darrow.  <P>  <I>Big Trouble</I> captures the tumultuous first decade of the twentieth century, when capital and labor, particularly in the raw, acquisitive West, were pitted against each other in something close to class war.  <P>  Lukas paints a vivid portrait of a time and place in which actress Ethel Barrymore, baseball phenom Walter Johnson, and editor William Allen White jostled with railroad magnate E. H. Harriman, socialist Eugene V. Debs, gunslinger Charlie Siringo, and Operative 21, the intrepid Pinkerton agent who infiltrated Darrow's defense team. This is a grand narrative of the United States as it charged, full of hope and trepidation, into the twentieth century.

    - Book
    - Mary Beth Norton
    - In this pioneering study of the ways in which the first settlers defined the power, prerogatives, and responsibilities of the sexes, one of our most incisive historians opens a window onto the world of Colonial America. Drawing on a wealth of contemporary documents, Mary Beth Norton tells the story of the Pinion clan, whose two-generation record of theft, adultery, and infanticide may have made them our first dysfunctional family. She reopens the case of Mistress Ann Hibbens, whose church excommunicated her for arguing that God had told husbands to listen to their wives. And here is the enigma of Thomas, or Thomasine Hall, who lived comfortably as both a man and a woman in 17th century Virginia. Wonderfully erudite and vastly readable, <b>Founding Mothers & Fathers</b> reveals both the philosophical assumptions and intimate domestic arrangements of our colonial ancestors in all their rigor, strangeness, and unruly passion.<br><p><br>"An important, imaginative book. Norton destroys our nostalgic image of a 'golden age' of family life and re-creates a more complex past whose assumptions and anxieties are still with us."--Raleigh News and Observer

    - Stephen Nissenbaum
    - "\"Fascinating.\"    <br><br>--The New York Times Book Review<br>    <br><br><br>Anyone who laments the excesses of Christmas might consider the Puritans of colonial Massachusetts: they simply outlawed the holiday. The Puritans had their reasons, since Christmas was once an occasion for drunkenness and riot, when poor \"wassailers  extorted food and drink from the well-to-do. In this intriguing and innovative work of social history, Stephen Nissenbaum rediscovers Christmas's carnival origins and shows how it was transformed, during the nineteenth century, into a festival of domesticity and consumerism. <br>    <br><br><br>Drawing on a wealth of period documents and illustrations, Nissenbaum charts the invention of our current Yuletide traditions, from St. Nicholas to the Christmas tree and, perhaps most radically, the practice of giving gifts to children. Bursting with detail, filled with subversive readings of such seasonal classics as \"A Visit from St. Nicholas  and A Christmas Carol, The Battle for Christmas captures the glorious strangeness of the past even as it helps us better understand our present.  <br>    <br><br><br>\"Christmas . . . too often fails to wholly satisfy the spirit or the senses. How and why the yuletide came to this is the subject of historian Stephen Nissenbaum's fascinating new study. \"    <br><br>--Newsweek"

    - Stories of Scottsboro
    - Book
    - James E. Goodman
    - "\"A rich and compelling narrative, as taut and suspenseful as good fiction. In places, Stories of Scottsboro is almost heartbreaking, not least because Goodman shows what people felt as well as what they thought.\" -- Washington Post Book World<P>To white Southerners, it was \"a heinous and unspeakable crime\" that flouted a taboo as old as slavery. To the Communist Party, which mounted the defense, the Scottsboro case was an ideal opportunity to unite issues of race and class. To jury after jury, the idea that nine black men had raped two white women on a train traveling through northern Alabama in 1931 was so self-evident that they found the Scottsboro boys guilty even after the U.S. Supreme Court had twice struck down the verdict and one of the \"victims\" had recanted.<P>This innovative and grippingly narrated work of history tells the story of a case that marked a watershed in American racial justice. Or, rather, it tells several stories. For out of dozens of period sources, Stories of Scottsboro re-creates not only what happened at Scottsboro, but the dissonant chords it struck in the hearts and minds of an entire nation.<P>\"Extraordinary.... To do justice to the Scottsboro story a book would have to combine edge-of-the-seat reportage and epic narrative sweep. And it is just such a book that James Goodman has given us, a beautifully realized history...written with complete authority, tight emotional control, and brilliant use of archival material.\" -- Chicago Tribune"

    - Lincoln in American Memory
    - Book
    - Merrill D. Peterson
    - "Lincoln's death, like his life, was an event of epic proportions. When the president was struck down at his moment of triumph, writes Merrill Peterson, \"sorrow--indescribable sorrow\" swept the nation. After lying in state in Washington, Lincoln's body was carried by a special funeral train to Springfield, Illinois, stopping in major cities along the way; perhaps a million people viewed the remains as memorial orations rang out and the world chorused its sincere condolences.  It was the apotheosis of the martyred President--the beginning of the transformation of a man into a mythic hero.    <P>In Lincoln in American Memory, historian Merrill Peterson provides a fascinating history of Lincoln's place in the American imagination from the hour of his death to the present.  In tracing the changing image of Lincoln through time, this wide-ranging account offers insight into the evolution and struggles of American politics and society--and into the character of Lincoln himself. Westerners, Easterners, even Southerners were caught up in the idealization of the late President, reshaping his memory and laying claim to his mantle, as his widow, son, memorial builders, and memorabilia collectors fought over his visible legacy. Peterson also looks at the complex responses of blacks to the memory of Lincoln, as they moved from exultation at the end of slavery to the harsh reality of free life amid deep poverty and segregation; at more than one memorial event for the great emancipator, the author notes, blacks were excluded.  He makes an engaging examination of the flood of reminiscences and biographies, from Lincoln's old law partner William H. Herndon to Carl Sandburg and beyond.  Serious historians were late in coming to the topic; for decades the myth-makers sought to shape the image of the hero President to suit their own agendas. He was made a voice of prohibition, a saloon-keeper, an infidel, a devout Christian, the first Bull Moose Progressive, a military blunderer and (after the First World War) a military genius, a white supremacist (according to D.W. Griffith and other Southern admirers), and a touchstone for the civil rights movement.  Through it all, Peterson traces five principal images of Lincoln: the savior of the Union, the great emancipator, man of the people, first American, and self-made man.  In identifying these archtypes, he tells us much not only of Lincoln but of our own identity as a people.    <P>More than thirty years ago, Peterson won the prestigious Bancroft Prize for The Jefferson Image in the American Mind.  The New York Times Book Review hailed it as \"an engrossing story of the uses and abuses of a great legend,\" saying that Peterson's writing is often \"brilliant.\" This absorbing book follows in the footsteps of that landmark work, leading us on a revealing tour through our changing image of our greatest president--and our changing image of ourselves."

    - "The Promise of the New South: Life After Reconstruction - 15th Anniversary Edition"
    - Book
    - Edward L. Ayers
    - At a public picnic in the South in the 1890s, a young man paid five cents for his first chance to hear the revolutionary Edison talking machine.  He eagerly listened as the soundman placed the needle down, only to find that through the tubes he held to his ears came the chilling sounds of a lynching.  In this story, with its blend of new technology and old hatreds, genteel picnics and mob violence, Edward Ayers captures the history of the South in the years between Reconstruction and the turn of the century. <br> Ranging from the Georgia coast to the Tennessee mountains, from the power brokers to tenant farmers, Ayers depicts a land of startling contrasts.  Ayers takes us from remote Southern towns, revolutionized by the spread of the railroads, to the statehouses where Democratic Redeemers swept away the legacy of Reconstruction; from the small farmers, trapped into growing nothing but cotton, to the new industries of Birmingham; from abuse and intimacy in the family to tumultuous public meetings of the prohibitionists.  He explores every aspect of society, politics, and the economy, detailing the importance of each in the emerging New South.   Central to the entire story is the role of race relations, from alliances and friendships between blacks and whites to the spread of Jim Crows laws and disfranchisement.  The teeming nineteenth-century South comes to life in these pages. <br> When this book first appeared in 1992, it won a broad array of prizes and was a finalist for both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize. The citation for the National Book Award declared Promise of the New South a vivid and masterfully detailed picture of the evolution of a new society. The Atlantic called it "one of the broadest and most original interpretations of southern history of the past twenty years.

    - Book
    - John Frederick Martin
    - In examining the founding of New England towns during the seventeenth century, John Frederick Martin investigates an old subject with fresh insight.  Whereas most historians emphasize communalism and absence of commerce in the seventeenth century, Martin demonstrates that colonists sought profits in town-founding, that town founders used business corporations to organize themselves into landholding bodies, and that multiple and absentee landholding was common.<p>In reviewing some sixty towns and the activities of one hundred town founders, Martin finds that many town residents were excluded from owning common lands and from voting.  It was not until the end of the seventeenth century, when proprietors separated from towns, that town institutions emerged as fully public entities for the first time.<p>Martin's study will challenge historians to rethink not only social history but also the cultural history of early New England.  Instead of taking sides in the long-standing debate between Puritan scholars and business historians, Martin identifies strains within Puritanism and the rest of the colonists' culture that both discouraged and encouraged land commerce, both supported and undermined communalism, both hindered and hastened development of the wilderness.  Rather than portray colonists one-dimensionally, Martin analyzes how several different and competing ethics coexisted within a single, complex, and vibrant New England culture.

    - Book
    - Richard White
    - This book seeks to step outside the simple stories of Indian/white relations--stories of conquest and assimilation and stories of cultural persistence. It is, instead, about a search for accommodation and common meaning. It tells how Europeans and Indians met, regarding each other as alien, as virtually nonhuman, and how between 1650 and 1815 they constructed a common, mutually comprehensible world in the region around the Great Lakes that the French called the "Pays d'en haut". Here the older worlds of the Algonquins and various Europeans overlapped, and their mixture created new systems of meaning and of exchange. Finally, the book tells of the breakdown of accommodation and common meanings and the recreation of the Indians as alien and exotic.   The process of accommodation described in this book takes place in a middle ground, a place in between cultures and peoples, and in between empires and non-state villages. On the middle ground people try to persuade others who are different than themselves  by appealing to what they perceive to be the values and practices of those others. From the creative misunderstandings that result, there arise shared meanings and new practices.

    - Book
    - Lizabeth Cohen
    - This book examines how it was possible and what it meant for ordinary factory workers to become effective unionists and national political participants by the mid-1930s. We follow Chicago workers as they make choices about whether to attend ethnic benefit society meetings or to go to the movies, whether to shop in local neighborhood stores or patronize the new A & P. Although workers may not have been political in traditional terms during the '20s, as they made daily decisions like these, they declared their loyalty in ways that would ultimately have political significance. As the depression worsened in the 1930s, not only did workers find their pay and working hours cut or eliminated, but the survival strategies they had developed during the 1920s were undermined. Looking elsewhere for help, workers adopted new ideological perspectives and overcame longstanding divisions among themselves to mount new kinds of collective action. Chicago workers' experiences as citizens, ethnics and blacks, wage earners and consumers all converged to make them into New Deal Democrats and CIO unionists.  First printed in 1990, Making a New Deal has become an established classic in American History.  The second edition includes a new introductory essay by Lizabeth Cohen.

    - "The Civil Rights Era: Origins and Development of National Policy, 1960-1972"
    - Book
    - Hugh Davis Graham
    - "The civil rights era conjures up a wide range of dramatic images--sit-ins at segregated diners, burning churches, the massive march on Washington, police dogs and firehoses turned on protesters, and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., lying dead from an assassin's bullet. But off the streets another civil rights struggle was also waged, less violent and far less visible but no less momentous, as the vast machinery of the Federal government turned to the task of securing equal rights.    <P>The Civil Rights Era offers the first comprehensive history of this other side of the battle for civil rights.  Based on extensive research in the Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon presidential archives, the National Archives, and special collections of the Library of Congress, this groundbreaking study recreates the intense debates in Congress and the White House that led to the breakthrough laws of 1964 and 1965--the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act--which banned discrimination against minorities and women.  Graham then follows the implementation of these policies through a thickening maze of federal agencies and court decisions.  In so doing, he reveals exactly how, in the dozen years from Kennedy through Nixon, the classic liberal agenda of non-discrimination evolved into the controversial program of affirmative action.  Lyndon Johnson emerges as a key figure, but surprisingly enough, it was Richard Nixon who established the preferential quotas of the Philadelphia Plan.  There are other surprising findings as well: for instance, Graham argues that despite similarities in rhetoric and tactics, the black civil rights and feminist movements during the 1960s switched philosophical positions. While black organizations shifted their demands from a \"color-blind Constitution\" to racial preferences, feminist leaders rejected special-protection laws in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment.    <P> The Civil Rights Era represents the definitive account of a revolution in government policy, offering keen insight into the civil rights legacy currently being challenged by the Supreme Court. Brilliantly researched and intelligently written, it offers a behind-the-scenes look at a pivotal moment in American history."

    - Book
    - Thomas P. Hughes
    - The book that helped earn Thomas P. Hughes his reputation as one of the foremost historians of technology of our age and a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 1990, <i>American Genesis</i> tells the sweeping story of America's technological revolution. Unlike other histories of technology, which focus on particular inventions like the light bulb or the automobile, <i>American Genesis</i> makes these inventions characters in a broad chronicle, both shaped by and shaping a culture. By weaving scientific and technological advancement into other cultural trends, Hughes demonstrates here the myriad ways in which the two are inexorably linked, and in a new preface, he recounts his earlier missteps in predicting the future of technology and follows its move into the information age.

    - This "masterful treatment of one of the most complex periods of American history" (<i>New Republic</i>) made history when it was originally published in 1988. It redefined how Reconstruction was viewed by historians and people everywhere in its chronicling of how Americans -- black and white -- responded to the unprecedented changes unleashed by the war and the end of slavery. This "smart book of enormous strengths" (<i>Boston Globe</i>) has since gone on to become the classic work on the wrenching post-Civil War period -- an era whose legacy reverberates still today in the United States.</p>

    - Book
    - Forrest McDonald
    - This is the first major interpretation of the framing of the Constitution to appear in more than two decades. Forrest McDonald, widely considered one of the foremost historians of the Constitution and of the early national period, reconstructs the intellectual world of the Founding Fathers--including their understanding of law, history political philosophy, and political economy, and their firsthand experience in public affairs--and then analyzes their behavior in the Constitutional Convention of 1787 in light of that world. No one has attempted to do so on such a scale before. McDonald's principal conclusion is that, though the Framers brought a variety of ideological and philosophical positions to bear upon their task of building a "new order of the ages," they were guided primarily by theiy own experience, their wisdom, and their common sense.

    - Rich in human detail, penetrating in analysis, this book is social history on an epic scale.  The first "transatlantic" history of the Irish, Emigrants and Exiles offers the fullest account yet of the diverse waves of Irish emigration to North America.    <P>Drawing on enormous original research, Miller focuses on the thought and behavior of the "ordinary" Irish emigrants, as revealed in their personal letters, diaries, journals, and memoirs as well as in their songs, poems and folklore.  Miller shows that the exile mentality was deeply rooted in Irish history, culture and personality, and it profoundly affected both the traumatic course of modern Irish history and the Irish experience in America.

    - Book
    - Robert Middlekauff
    - The first book to appear in the illustrious Oxford History of the United States, this critically acclaimed volume--a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize--offers an unsurpassed history of the Revolutionary War and the birth of the American republic.<br>        Beginning with the French and Indian War and continuing to the election of George Washington as first president, Robert Middlekauff offers a panoramic history of the conflict between England and America, highlighting the drama and anguish of the colonial struggle for independence. Combining the political and the personal, he provides a compelling account of the key events that precipitated the war, from the Stamp Act to the Tea Act, tracing the gradual gathering of American resistance that culminated in the Boston Tea Party and "the shot heard 'round the world." The heart of the book features a vivid description of the eight-year-long war, with gripping accounts of battles and campaigns, ranging from Bunker Hill and Washington's crossing of the Delaware to the brilliant victory at Hannah's Cowpens and the final triumph at Yorktown, paying particular attention to what made men fight in these bloody encounters. The book concludes with an insightful look at the making of the Constitution in the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 and the struggle over ratification. Through it all, Middlekauff gives the reader a vivid sense of how the colonists saw these events and the importance they gave to them. Common soldiers and great generals, Sons of Liberty and African slaves, town committee-men and representatives in congress--all receive their due. And there are particularly insightful portraits of such figures as Sam and John Adams, James Otis, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and many others. This new edition has been revised and expanded, with fresh coverage of topics such as mob reactions to British measures before the War, military medicine, women's role in the Revolution, American Indians, the different kinds of war fought by the Americans and the British, and the ratification of the Constitution. The book also has a new epilogue and an updated bibliography.<br>       The cause for which the colonists fought, liberty and independence, was glorious indeed. Here is an equally glorious narrative of an event that changed the world, capturing the profound and passionate struggle to found a free nation.<br>  The Oxford History of the United States<br> The Oxford History of the United States is the most respected multi-volume history of our nation. The series includes three Pulitzer Prize winners, a New York Times bestseller, and winners of the Bancroft and Parkman Prizes. The Atlantic Monthly has praised it as "the most distinguished series in American historical scholarship," a series that "synthesizes a generation's worth of historical inquiry and knowledge into one literally state-of-the-art book." Conceived under the general editorship of C. Vann Woodward and Richard Hofstadter, and now under the editorship of David M. Kennedy, this renowned series blends social, political, economic, cultural, diplomatic, and military history into coherent and vividly written narrative.

He describes how Southern whites, living chiefly in small, rural, agrarian surroundings, in which everyone knew everyone else, established the local hierarchy of kinfolk and neighbors according to their individual and familial reputation. By claiming honor and dreading shame, they controlled their slaves, ruled their households, established the social rankings of themselves, kinfolk, and neighbors, and responded ferociously against perceived threats. The shamed and shameless sometimes suffered grievously for defying community norms. Wyatt-Brown further explains how a Southern elite refined the ethic.  Learning, gentlemanly behavior, and deliberate rather than reckless resort to arms softened the cruder form, which the author calls "primal honor." In either case, honor required men to demonstrate their prowess and engage in fierce defense of individual, family, community, and regional reputation by duel, physical encounter, or war. Subordination of African-Americans was uppermost in this Southern ethic. Any threat, whether from the slaves themselves or from outside agitation, had to be met forcefully.  Slavery was the root cause of the Civil War, but, according to Wyatt-Brown, honor pulled the trigger.  <br>         Featuring a new introduction by the author, this anniversary edition of a classic work offers readers a compelling view of Southern culture before the Civil War.

    - "Over Here: The First World War and American Society"
    - Book
    - David M. Kennedy
    - The Great War of 1914-1918 confronted the United States with one of the most wrenching crises in the nation's history. It also left a residue of disruption and disillusion that spawned an even more ruinous conflict scarcely a generation later. Over Here is the single-most comprehensive discussion of the impact of World War I on American society. This 25th anniversary edition includes a new afterword from Pulitzer Prize-winning author David M. Kennedy, that explains his reasons for writing the original edition as well as his opinions on the legacy of Wilsonian idealism, most recently reflected in President George W. Bush's national security strategy. More than a chronicle of the war years, Over Here uses therecord of America's experience in the Great War as a prism through which to view early twentieth century American society. The ways in which America mobilized for the war, chose to fight it, and then went about the business of enshrining it in memory all indicate important aspects of enduring American character. An American history classic, Over Here reflects on a society's struggle with the pains of war, and offers trenchant insights into the birth of modern America.

    - I absolutely loved this book.  I am a big fan of historical fiction that goes down fast and easy. And while reading this book I felt propelled through the words at breakneck pace, exhilarated and enjoying the ride. It was fascinating to learn about the Dominican Republic (DR) through Oscar and his fuku'd family.  Just learning about the strength of the fuku pointed in any direction that dares to mess with Trujillo was worth it. (Read the Kennedy connection for some funny and fascinating folklore). I knew absolutely nothing about the DR before I read this book.  Now I feel that I have a sense of it, at least from the perspective of Oscar and his poor family. Trujillo = Devil. Zafa.

    - I just finished To Kill A Mockingbird last night. Somehow I missed it as required reading in my education.  I can see how this would be a great book to have to read while growing up especially as a white person. It's such an amazing example of the gross injustice pressed upon people for the sole and sickening reason of skin color. Many of our Pulitzer Prize winners tackle racism and slavery. I wonder if this 1961 winner was the first winner to do so?

      I don't really like putting these kinds of images in my head. However, there's something in me that makes me happy I read this book, maybe it was the writing, maybe the love between the father and son, maybe the ending. After all was said and done I still felt hopeful.

    - I had a hard time getting through this book even though I really thought the ideas were sound and interesting.  I thoroughly enjoyed the PBS special based on the book and would highly recommend it.
