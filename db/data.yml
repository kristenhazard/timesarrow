    - Geraldine Brooks
    - "  From Louisa May Alcott\xE2\x80\x99s beloved classic <I>Little Women</I>, Geraldine Brooks has animated the   character of the absent father, March, and crafted a story \"filled with the ache of love and marriage and   with the power of war upon the mind and heart of one unforgettable man\" (Sue Monk Kidd). With  \"pitch-perfect writing\" (<I>USA Today</I>), Brooks follows March as he leaves behind his family to aid   the Union cause in the Civil War. His experiences will utterly change his marriage and challenge his most   ardently held beliefs. A lushly written, wholly original tale steeped in the details of another time,   <I>March</I> secures Geraldine Brooks\xE2\x80\x99s place as a renowned author of historical fiction."

    - "<b>A dazzling triumph from the bestselling author of <i>The Virgin Suicides</i>--the astonishing tale of a gene that passes down through three generations of a Greek-American family and flowers in the body of a teenage girl.</b><br><br>In the spring of 1974, Calliope Stephanides, a student at a girls' school in Grosse Pointe, finds herself drawn to a chain-smoking, strawberry blond clasmate with a gift for acting. The passion that furtively develops between them--along with Callie's failure to develop--leads Callie to suspect that she is not like other girls. In fact, she is not really a girl at all.<br><br>The explanation for this shocking state of affairs takes us out of suburbia- back before the Detroit race riots of 1967, before the rise of the Motor City and Prohibition, to 1922, when the Turks sacked Smyrna and Callie's grandparents fled for their lives. Back to a tiny village in Asia Minor where two lovers, and one rare genetic mutation, set in motion the metamorphosis that will turn Callie into a being both mythical and perfectly real: a hermaphrodite.<br><br>Spanning eight decades--and one unusually awkward adolescence- Jeffrey Eugenides's long-awaited second novel is a grand, utterly original fable of crossed bloodlines, the intricacies of gender, and the deep, untidy promptings of desire. It marks the fulfillment of a huge talent, named one of America's best young novelists by both <i>Granta </i>and <i>The New Yorker</i>.<br>"

    - The Road
    - Book
    - Cormac McCarthy
    - |-
      A searing, postapocalyptic novel destined to become Cormac McCarthys masterpiece.
      
      A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they dont know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged foodand each other.
      
      The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, each the others world entire, are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.

    - Book
    - Edward P. Jones
    - <p> One of the most acclaimed novels in recent memory, <i>The Known World</i> is a daring and ambitious work by Pulitzer Prize winner Edward P. Jones. </p> <p> <i>The Known World</i> tells the story of Henry Townsend, a black farmer and former slave who falls under the tutelage of William Robbins, the most powerful man in Manchester County, Virginia. Making certain he never circumvents the law, Townsend runs his affairs with unusual discipline. But when death takes him unexpectedly, his widow, Caldonia, can't uphold the estate's order, and chaos ensues. Jones has woven a footnote of history into an epic that takes an unflinching look at slavery in all its moral complexities. </p>

    - "Twenty-four years after her first novel, <I>Housekeeping</I>, Marilynne Robinson returns with an intimate tale of three generations from the Civil War to the twentieth century: a story about fathers and sons and the spiritual battles that still rage at America's heart. Writing in the tradition of Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman, Marilynne Robinson's beautiful, spare, and spiritual prose allows \"even the faithless reader to feel the possibility of transcendent order\" (<I>Slate</I>). In the luminous and unforgettable voice of Congregationalist minister John Ames, Gilead reveals the human condition and the often unbearable beauty of an ordinary life."

Roth's protagonist is Swede Levov, a legendary athlete at his Newark high school, who grows up in the booming postwar years to marry a former Miss New Jersey, inherit his father's glove factory, and move into a stone house in the idyllic hamlet of Old Rimrock. And then one day in 1968, Swede's beautiful American luck deserts him.<br><br>For Swede's adored daughter, Merry, has grown from a loving, quick-witted girl into a sullen, fanatical teenager\xE2\x80\x94a teenager capable of an outlandishly savage act of political terrorism. And overnight Swede is wrenched out of the longer-for American pastoral and into the indigenous American berserk. Compulsively readable, propelled by sorrow, rage, and a deep compassion for its characters, this is Roth's masterpiece."

    - Sidney Poitier
    - "\"I have no wish to play the pontificating fool, pretending that I\xE2\x80\x99ve suddenly come up with the answers to all life\xE2\x80\x99s questions. Quite that contrary, I began this book as an exploration, an exercise in self-questing. In other words, I wanted to find out, as I looked back at a long and complicated life, with many twists and turns, how well I\xE2\x80\x99ve done at measuring up to the values I myself have set.\"  <BR>--Sidney Poitier    <P>In this luminous memoir, a true American icon looks back on his celebrated life and career. His body of work is arguably the most morally significant in cinematic history, and the power and influence of that work are indicative of the character of the man behind the many storied roles. Sidney Poitier here explores these elements of character and personal values to take his own measure -- as a man, as a husband and a father, and as an actor.    <P>Poitier credits his parents and his childhood on tiny Cat Island in the Bahamas for equipping him with the unflinching sense of right and wrong and of self-worth that he has never surrendered and that have dramatically shaped his world. \"In the kind of place where I grew up,\" recalls Poitier, \"what\xE2\x80\x99s coming at you is the sound of the sea and the smell of the wind and momma\xE2\x80\x99s voice and the voice of your dad and the craziness of your brothers and sisters \xE2\x80\xA6 and that\xE2\x80\x99s it.\" Without television, radio, and material distractions to obscure what matters most, he could enjoy the simple things, endure the long commitments, and find true meaning in his life.    <P>Poitier was uncompromising as he pursued a personal and public life that would honor his upbringing and the invaluable legacy of his parents. Just a few years after his introduction to indoor plumbing and the automobile, Poitier broke racial barrier after racial barrier to launch a pioneering acting career. Committed to the notion that what one does for a living articulates to who one is, Poitier played only forceful and affecting characters who said something positive, useful, and lasting about the human condition.    <P>Here is Poitier\xE2\x80\x99s own introspective look at what has informed his performances and his life. Poitier explores the nature of sacrifice and commitment, price and humility, rage and forgiveness, and paying the price for artistic integrity. What emerges is a picture of a man in the face of limits \xE2\x80\x93 his own and the world\xE2\x80\x99s. A triumph of the spirit, <I>The Measure of a Man</i> captures the essential Poitier."

    - Anna Karenina (Oprah's Book Club)
    - Book
    - Leo Tolstoy
    - <I>Anna Karenina</I> tells of the doomed love affair between the  sensuous and rebellious Anna and the dashing officer, Count  Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and  must endure the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and richly  textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major  characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of  city and country life and all the variations on love and family  happiness.  While previous versions have softened the robust, and  sometimes shocking, quality of Tolstoy's writing, Pevear and  Volokhonsky have produced a translation true to his powerful  voice. This award-winning team's authoritative edition also includes  an illuminating introduction and explanatory notes. Beautiful,  vigorous, and eminently readable, this <I>Anna Karenina</I> will be  the definitive text for generations to come.

    - The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (Oprah's Book Club)
    - Book
    - Carson McCullers
    - With the publication of her first novel, THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER,  Carson McCullers, all of twenty-three, became a literary  sensation. With its profound sense of moral isolation and its  compassionate glimpses into its characters' inner lives, the novel is  considered McCullers' finest work, an enduring masterpiece first  published by Houghton Mifflin in 1940. At its center is the deaf-mute  John Singer, who becomes the confidant for all various types of  misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for  escape from small town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane,  Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's  heroine (and loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her  music. Wonderfully attune to the spiritual isolation that underlies  the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the  South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives  voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated -- and,  through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal  search for beauty.<BR> Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her  ability "to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace  white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness."  She writes "with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming," said  the NEW YORK TIMES. McCullers became an overnight literary sensation,  but her novel has endured, just as timely and powerful today as when  it was first published. THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER is Carson  McCullers at her most compassionate, endearing best.

    - "<p>One of the 20th century's enduring works, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize\xE2\x80\x93winning career.</p> <p>The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buend\xC3\xADa family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buend\xC3\xADa family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America.</p> <p>Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel Garc\xC3\xADa M\xC3\xA1rquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.</p> <p>Alternately reverential and comical, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.</p>"

This new translation by Marion Weisel, Elie's wife  and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language  and spirit truest to the author's original intent.  And in the  substantive new preface, Elie Wiesel reflects on the enduring  importance of <I>Night</I> and his lifelong, passionate dedication to  ensuring that the world never forgets man capacity for inhumanity to  man.    <P><I>Night</I> offers much more than a litany of the daily terrors, everyday  perversions, and rampant sadism at Auschwitz and Buchenwald; it also  eloquently addresses many of the philosophical as well as personal  questions implicit in any serious consideration of what the Holocaust  was, what it meant, and what its legacy is and will be.

    - Navigating between the Indian traditions they've inherited and the baffling new world, the characters in Jhumpa Lahiri's elegant, touching stories seek love beyond the barriers of culture and generations. In "A Temporary Matter," published in The New Yorker, a young Indian-American couple faces the heartbreak of a stillborn birth while their Boston neighborhood copes with a nightly blackout. In the title story, an interpreter guides an American family through the India of their ancestors and hears an astonishing confession. Lahiri writes with deft cultural insight reminiscent of Anita Desai and a nuanced depth that recalls Mavis Gallant. She is an important and powerful new voice.

By the end of the novel, these three stories intertwine in remarkable ways, and finally come together in an act of subtle and haunting grace.<br>"

    - Philip Roth
    - "As the American century draws to an uneasy close, Philip Roth gives us a novel of unqualified greatness that is an elegy for all our century's promises of prosperity, civic order,  and domestic bliss. Roth's protagonist is Swede Levov, a legendary athlete at his Newark high school, who grows up in the booming postwar years to marry a former Miss New Jersey, inherit his father's glove factory, and move into a stone house in the idyllic hamlet of Old Rimrock. And then one day in 1968, Swede's beautiful American luck deserts him.<br><br>For Swede's adored daughter, Merry, has grown from a loving, quick-witted girl into a sullen, fanatical teenager\xE2\x80\x94a teenager capable of an outlandishly savage act of political terrorism. And overnight Swede is wrenched out of the longer-for American pastoral and into the indigenous American berserk. Compulsively readable, propelled by sorrow, rage, and a deep compassion for its characters, this is Roth's masterpiece."

    - Annie Proulx
    - <P> Winner of the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, <I>The Shipping News</I> is a celebration of Annie Proulx's genius for storytelling and her vigorous contribution to the art of the novel. <P> Quoyle, a third-rate newspaper hack, with a "head shaped like a crenshaw, no neck, reddish hair...features as bunched as kissed fingertips," is wrenched violently out of his workaday life when his two-timing wife meets her just deserts. An aunt convinces Quoyle and his two emotionally disturbed daughters to return with her to the starkly beautiful coastal landscape of their ancestral home in Newfoundland. Here, on desolate Quoyle's Point, in a house empty except for a few mementos of the family's unsavory past, the battered members of three generations try to cobble up new lives. <P> Newfoundland is a country of coast and cove where the mercury rarely rises above 70 degrees, the local culinary delicacy is cod cheeks, and it's easier to travel by boat and snowmobile than on anything with wheels. In this harsh place of cruel storms, a collapsing fishery, and chronic unemployment, the aunt sets up as a yacht upholsterer in nearby Killick-Claw, and Quoyle finds a job reporting the shipping news for the local weekly, the <I>Gammy Bird</I> (a paper that specializes in sexual-abuse stories and grisly photos of car accidents). <P> As the long winter closes its jaws of ice, each of the Quoyles confronts private demons, reels from catastrophe to minor triumph -- in the company of the obsequious Mavis Bangs; Diddy Shovel the strongman; drowned Herald Prowse; cane-twirling Beety; Nutbeem, who steals foreign news from the radio; a demented cousin the aunt refuses to recognize; the much-zippered Alvin Yark; silent Wavey; and old Billy Pretty, with his bag of secrets. By the time of the spring storms Quoyle has learned how to gut cod, to escape from a pickle jar, and to tie a true lover's knot.

    - Anna Karenina (Oprah's Book Club)
    - Book
    - Leo Tolstoy
    - <I>Anna Karenina</I> tells of the doomed love affair between the  sensuous and rebellious Anna and the dashing officer, Count  Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and  must endure the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and richly  textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major  characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of  city and country life and all the variations on love and family  happiness.  While previous versions have softened the robust, and  sometimes shocking, quality of Tolstoy's writing, Pevear and  Volokhonsky have produced a translation true to his powerful  voice. This award-winning team's authoritative edition also includes  an illuminating introduction and explanatory notes. Beautiful,  vigorous, and eminently readable, this <I>Anna Karenina</I> will be  the definitive text for generations to come.

    - The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter
    - Book
    - Carson McCullers
    - With the publication of her first novel, THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER,  Carson McCullers, all of twenty-three, became a literary  sensation. With its profound sense of moral isolation and its  compassionate glimpses into its characters' inner lives, the novel is  considered McCullers' finest work, an enduring masterpiece first  published by Houghton Mifflin in 1940. At its center is the deaf-mute  John Singer, who becomes the confidant for all various types of  misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for  escape from small town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane,  Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's  heroine (and loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her  music. Wonderfully attune to the spiritual isolation that underlies  the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the  South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives  voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated -- and,  through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal  search for beauty.<BR> Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her  ability "to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace  white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness."  She writes "with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming," said  the NEW YORK TIMES. McCullers became an overnight literary sensation,  but her novel has endured, just as timely and powerful today as when  it was first published. THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER is Carson  McCullers at her most compassionate, endearing best.

    - Book
    - Gabriel Garcia Marquez
    - "<p>One of the 20th century's enduring works, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize\xE2\x80\x93winning career.</p> <p>The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buend\xC3\xADa family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buend\xC3\xADa family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America.</p> <p>Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel Garc\xC3\xADa M\xC3\xA1rquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.</p> <p>Alternately reverential and comical, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.</p>"

    - Book
    - Toni Morrison
    - Toni Morrison's first novel, <b>The Bluest Eye</b> (1970), was acclaimed as the work of an important talent, written--as John Leonard said in <i>The New York Times</i>--in a prose "so precise, so faithful to speech and so charged with pain and wonder that the novel becomes poetry."<br><br><b>Sula</b> has the same power, the same beauty.<br><br>At its center--a friendship between two women, a friendship whose intensity first sustains, then injures. Sula and Nel--both black, both smart, both poor, raised in a small Ohio town--meet when they are twelve, wishbone thin and dreaming of princes.<br><br>Through their girlhood years they share everything--perceptions, judgments, yearnings, secrets, even crime--until Sula gets out, out of the Bottom, the hilltop neighborhood where beneath the sporting life of the men hanging around the place in headrags and soft felt hats there hides a fierce resentment at failed crops, lost jobs, thieving insurance men, bug-ridden flour...at the invisible line that cannot be overstepped.  <br><br>Sula leaps it and roams the cities of America for ten years. Then she returns to the town, to her friend. But Nel is a wife now, settled with her man and her three children. She belongs. She accommodates to the Bottom, where you avoid the hand of God by getting in it, by staying <i>upright,</i> helping out at church suppers, asking after folks--where you deal with evil by surviving it.  <br><br>Not Sula. As willing to feel pain as to give pain, she can never accommodate. Nel can't understand her any more, and the others never did. Sula scares them. Mention her now, and they recall that she put her grandma in an old folks' home (the old lady who let a train take her leg for the insurance)...that a child drowned in the river years ago...that there was a plague of robins when she first returned...<br><br>In clear, dark, resonant language, Toni Morrison brilliantly evokes not only a bond between two lives, but the harsh, loveless, ultimately mad world in which that bond is destroyed, the world of the Bottom and its people, through forty years, up to the time of their bewildered realization that even more than they feared Sula, their pariah, they needed her.

The time is 1975. The place is an unnamed city by the sea. The government has just declared a State of Emergency, in whose upheavals four strangers--a spirited widow, a young student uprooted from his idyllic hill station, and two tailors who have fled the caste violence of their native village--will be thrust together, forced to share one cramped apartment and an uncertain future. <br><br>As the characters move from distrust to friendship and from friendship to love, <b>A Fine Balance</b> creates an enduring panorama of the human spirit in an inhuman state.

The oldest, Gary, a once-stable portfolio manager and family man, is trying to convince his wife and himself, despite clear signs to the contrary, that he is not clinically depressed. The middle child, Chip, has lost his seemingly secure academic job and is failing spectacularly at his new line of work. And Denise, the youngest, has escaped a disastrous marriage only to pour her youth and beauty down the drain of an affair with a married man-or so her mother fears.

    - "Lalita Tademy was a successful vice president at Sun Microsystems when she began what became an obsessive two-year search to uncover the story of her family's roots. It was a personal odyssey that took her back to the early l800s and a small rural community on Louisiana's Cane River. There, digging through official records, conducting interviews, and relying on the expertise of professional genealogists, Tademy was able to bring to vivid life four remarkable women--her great, great, great, great grandmother Elisabeth; her great, great, great grandmother Suzette; her great, great grandmother Philomene; and her great-grandmother Emily.  Beginning in slavery, sweeping through the Civil War, and bringing us into the pre-Civil Rights South, we follow the struggles of these four women through extraordinary hardships as they learn to empower themselves and, despite overwhelming pressures, get their due and preserve their heritage. Meticulously researched and beautifully written, this woman's Roots presents a slice of American history never before seen in such piercing and personal detail.  "

    - In the tradition of <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> and <i>The Cape Ann</i>, a funny, sad, wise, and redeeming first novel about a young girl's battle with a troubling affliction.  Rural Kentucky in the 1950s is not an easy place to grow up in, and it's especially hard for 10-year-old Icy Sparks, an orphan who lives with her grandparents. Life becomes even more difficult for Icy when the violent tics and uncontrollable cursing begin. Icy's adolescence is marred by the humiliation brought on by her mysterious condition, and its all-too-visible symptoms are the source of endless hilarity as everyone around her offers an opinion about what's troubling the girl. Eventually, Icy finds solace in the company of an obese woman who knows what it's like to be an outcast in this tightly knit Appalachian community. Narrated by a now-grown Icy, this first novel shimmers with warmth and humor as it recounts a young girl's painful and poignant journey to womanhood--and the many lives she touches and enriches along the way.<br> <br>--<i>Icy Sparks</i> was a <i>New York Times</i> Editor's Choice <br> <br>"Awesomely intelligent . . .

    - "In this superb novel by the beloved author of Talk Before Sleep, The Pull of the Moon, and Until the Real Thing Comes Along, a woman re-creates her life after divorce by opening up her house and her heart.<br>Samantha's husband has left her, and after a spree of overcharging at Tiffany's, she settles down to reconstruct a life for herself and her eleven-year-old son. Her eccentric mother tries to help by fixing her up with dates, but a more pressing problem is money. To meet her mortgage payments, Sam decides to take in boarders. The first is an older woman who offers sage advice and sorely needed comfort; the second, a maladjusted student, is not quite so helpful. A new friend, King, an untraditional man, suggests that Samantha get out, get going, get work. But her real work is this: In order to emerge from grief and the past, she has to learn how to make her own happiness. In order to really see people, she has to look within her heart. And in order to know who she is, she has to remember--and reclaim--the person she used to be, long before she became someone else in an effort to save her marriage. Open House is a love story about what can blossom between a man and a woman, and within a woman herself.<br><br><br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i>"

And at least you've got a family you can stand even if they are all sisters.   One day you're that guy, and the next day you're assigned to a social worker and a therapist and given the choice of either being a LEGAL ADULT with three DEPENDENTS or an ORPHAN with NOBODY.\" --From <I>Back Roads</I><BR>     Harley Altmyer should be in college drinking Rolling Rock and chasing girls. He should be freed from his closed-minded, stricken coal town, with its lack of jobs and no sense of humor. Instead, he's constantly reminded of just how messed up his life is.<BR>     With his mother in jail for killing his abusive father, Harley is an orphan with the responsibilities of an adult and the fiery, aggressive libido of a teenager. Just nineteen years old, he's marooned in the Pennsylvania backwoods caring for his three younger sisters, whose feelings about him range from stifling dependence to loathing. And once he develops an obsession with the sexy, melancholic mother of two living down the road, those Victoria's Secret catalogs just won't do the trick anymore. He wants Callie Mercer so badly he fears he will explode. But it's the family secrets, the lies, and the unspoken truths that light the fuse and erupt into a series of staggering surprises, leaving what's left of his family in tatters. Through every ordeal, the unforgettable Harley could never know that his endearing humor, his love for his sisters, and his bumbling heroics would redeem them all.<BR>     Funny and heartbreaking, Tawni O'Dell's pitch-perfect characters capture the maddening confusion of adolescence and the prickly nature of family with irony and unerring honesty. <I>Back Roads</I> is a riveting novel by a formidable new talent."

Dutifully accompanying her newly unemployed husband, Ellen has brought her two children into the home of her in-laws on Vinegar Hill -- a loveless house suffused with the settling dust of bitterness and routine -- where calculated cruelty is a way of life preserved and perpetuated in the service of a rigid, exacting and angry God. Behind a facade of false piety, there are sins and secrets in this place that could crush a vibrant young woman's passionate spirit. And here Ellen must find the straight to endure, change, and grow in the all-pervading darkness that threatens to destroy everything she is and everyone she loves. </p>

In time she becomes his  lover--then she inexplicably disappears. When Michael next sees her, he is  a young law student, and she is on trial for a hideous crime. As he watches  her refuse to defend her innocence, Michael gradually realizes that Hanna  may be guarding a secret she considers more shameful than murder."

    - <P>In the backwoods of Mississippi, a land of honeysuckle and grapevine, Jewel and her husband, Leston, are truly blessed; they have five fine children. When Brenda Kay is born in 1943, Jewel gives thanks for a healthy baby, last-born and most welcome. <I>Jewel</I> is the story of how quickly a life can change; how, like lightning, an unforeseen event can set us on a course without reason or compass. In this story of a woman's devotion to the child who is both her burden and God's singular way of smiling on her, Bret Lott has created a mother-daughter relationship of matchless intensity and beauty, and one of the finest, most indomitable heroines in contemporary American fiction.

    - Where the Heart Is (Oprah's Book Club)
    - Book
    - Billie Letts
    - "Oprah Book Club-\xC2\xAB Selection, December 1998: A funny thing happens to Novalee Nation on her way to Bakersfield, California. Her ne'er-do-well boyfriend, Willie Jack Pickens, abandons her in an Oklahoma Wal-Mart and takes off on his own, leaving her with just 10 dollars and the clothes on her back. Not that hard luck is anything new to Novalee, who is \"seventeen, seven months pregnant, thirty-seven pounds overweight--and superstitious about sevens.... For most people, sevens were lucky. But not for her,\" Billie Letts writes. \"She'd had a bad history with them, starting with her seventh birthday, the day Momma Nell ran away with a baseball umpire named Fred...\"Still, finding herself alone and penniless in Sequoyah, Oklahoma is enough to make even someone as inured to ill fortune as Novalee want to give up and die. Fortunately, the Wal-Mart parking lot is the Sequoyah equivalent of a town square, and within hours Novalee has met three people who will change her life: Sister Thelma Husband, a kindly eccentric; Benny Goodluck, a young Native American boy; and Moses Whitecotton, an elderly African American photographer. For the next two months, Novalee surreptitiously makes her home in the Wal-Mart, sleeping there at night, exploring the town by day. When she goes into labor and delivers her baby there, however, Novalee learns that sometimes it's not so bad to depend on the kindness of strangers--especially if one of them happens to be Sam Walton, the superchain's founder.Where the Heart Is oddly mixes heart-warming vignettes and surprising, brutal violence. Novalee's story is juxtaposed with occasional chapters chronicling Willy Jack's downward spiral into prison, disappointment, and degradation. And even in Sequoyah, sudden storms, domestic violence, kidnapping, and deadly fires punctuate Novalee's progress from homeless, unwed teen mom to successful, happy member of the community. This is not a subtle book; there's never any doubt that our heroine will make a home for herself and her baby or that Willy Jack will get what he deserves for abandoning them. Still, Billie Letts has created several memorable characters, and there's always room for another novel that celebrates the life-affirming qualities of reading, the importance of education, and the power of love to change lives. --Alix Wilber"

After a decade of luxe living in Atlanta, Ava Johnson has returned to tiny Idlewild, Michigan -- her fabulous career and power plans smashed to bits on one dark truth: Ava has tested positive for HIV. Bur rather than a sorrowful end, her homecoming is a new beginning. Because, in the ten-plus years since she left, all the problems of the big city have invaded the sleepy community of her childhood. Because dear friends and family sorely need her help in the face of impending trouble and tragedy, and Ava cannot turn her back on them. And because, most importantly, Ava Johnson is inexplicabley and undeniably falling in love."

    - Wally Lamb
    - "E-book extra: \"Who Is Wally Lamb?\" The author recalls events surrounding the acclaimed publication of I Know This Much Is True. ( Not available in print editions of this work.)<BR><BR>Wally Lamb's masterful novel of transgression and redemption, now in e-book format.<BR><BR>A contemporary retelling of an ancient Hindu myth: a proud king must confront his demons to achieve salvation. Change yourself, the myth instructs, and you will inhabit a renovated world.... <BR><BR>Dominick Birdsey's entire life has been compromised and constricted by anger and fear, by the paranoid schizophrenic twin brother, Thomas, whom he both deeply loves and resents. <BR><BR>Born in the waning moments of 1949 and the opening minutes of 1950, the twins are physical mirror images who grow into separate yet connected entities: the seemingly strong and protective yet fearful Dominick, his mother's watchful \"monkey\"; and the seemingly weak and sweet yet noble Thomas, his mother's gentle \"bunny.\" From childhood, Dominick fights for both separation and wholeness -- and ultimately self-protection -- in a house of fear dominated by Ray, a bully who abuses his power over these stepsons whose biological father is a mystery. <BR><BR>Dominick's lifelong talent for survival comes at an enormous cost, including the breakup of his marriage to the warm, beautiful Dessa, whom he still loves. And it will be put to the ultimate test when Thomas, a Bible-spouting zealot, commits an unthinkable act that threatens the tenuous balance of both his and Dominick's lives. <BR><BR>To save himself, Dominick must confront not only the pain of his past but the dark secrets he has locked deep within himself, and the sins of his ancestors -- a quest that will lead him beyond the confines of his blue-collar New England town to the volcanic foothills of Sicily 's Mount Etna, where his ambitious and vengefully proud grandfather was born. <BR><BR>Here Dominick learns that power, wrongly used, defeats the oppressor as well as the oppressed, and now, picking through the humble shards of his deconstructed life, he will search for the courage and love to forgive, to expiate his and his ancestors' transgressions, and finally to rebuild himself beyond the haunted shadow of his twin. <BR><BR>Set against the vivid panoply of twentieth-century America and filled with richly drawn, memorable characters, this deeply moving and thoroughly satisfying novel brings to light humanity's deepest needs and fears, our aloneness, our desire for love and acceptance, our struggle to survive at all costs. Joyous, mystical, and exquisitely written, I Know This Much Is True is an extraordinary experience that will leave no reader untouched. "

    - "\"They shoot the white girl first. With the others they can take their time.\" Toni Morrison's first novel since she was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature opens with a horrifying scene of mob violence then chronicles its genesis in a small all-black town in rural Oklahoma. Founded by descendants of free slaves as intent on isolating themselves from the outside world as it once was on rejecting them, the patriarchal community of Ruby is built on righteousness, rigidly enforced moral law, and fear. But seventeen miles away, another group of exiles has gathered in a promised land of their own. And it is upon these women in flight from death and despair that nine male citizens of Ruby will lay their pain, their terror, and their murderous rage... <P> Paradise is a tour de force of storytelling power, richly imagined and elegantly composed. Morrison challenges our most fiercely held beliefs as she weaves folklore and history, memory and myth, into an unforgettable meditation on race, religion, gender, and the way a society can turn on itself until it is forced to explode."

    - Stones from the River
    - Book
    - Ursula Hegi
    - <I>Stones from the River</I> is a daring, dramatic and complex novel of life in Germany. It is set in Burgdorf, a small fictional German town, between 1915 and 1951. The protagonist is Trudi Montag, a Zwerg -- the German word for dwarf woman. As a dwarf she is set apart, the outsider whose physical "otherness" has a corollary in her refusal to be a part of Burgdorf's silent complicity during and after World War II. Trudi establishes her status and power, not through beauty, marriage, or motherhood, but rather as the town's librarian and relentless collector of stories.  <P>Through Trudi's unblinking eyes, we witness the growing impact of Nazism on the ordinary townsfolk of Burgdorf as they are thrust on to a larger moral stage and forced to make choices that will forever mark their lives. <I>Stones from the River</I> is a story of secrets, parceled out masterfully by Trudi -- and by Ursula Hegi -- as they reveal the truth about living through unspeakable times.

    - The Executioner's Song
    - Book
    - Norman Mailer
    - "Winner of the 1980 Pulitzer Prize<br><br>In what is arguably his greatest book, America's most heroically ambitious writer follows<br>the short, blighted career of Gary Gilmore, an intractably violent product of America's<br>prisons who became notorious for two reasons: first, for robbing two men in 1976, then<br>killing them in cold blood; and, second, after being tried and convicted, for insisting on<br>dying for his crime. To do so, he had to fight a system that seemed paradoxically intent on<br>keeping him alive long after it had sentenced him to death.<br><br>Norman Mailer tells Gilmore's story--and those of the men and women caught up in his<br>procession toward the firing squad--with implacable authority, steely compassion, and a<br>restraint that evokes the parched landscapes and stern theology of Gilmore's Utah. The<br>Executioner's Song is a trip down the wrong side of the tracks to the deepest sources of<br>American loneliness and violence. It is a towering achievement--impossible to put down, impossible to forget."

    - Book
    - Harper Lee
    - <blockquote><center> <p>Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning masterwork of honor and injustice in the deep South -- and the heroism of one man in the face of blind and violent hatred</p> </center></blockquote> <p>One of the best-loved stories of all time, <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i> has been translated into more than forty languages, sold more than thirty million copies worldwide, served as the basis of an enormously popular motion picture, and was voted one of the best novels of the twentieth century by librarians across the country. A gripping, heart-wrenching, and wholly remarkable tale of coming-of-age in a South poisoned by virulent prejudice, it views a world of great beauty and savage inequities through the eyes of a young girl, as her father -- a crusading local lawyer -- risks everything to defend a black man unjustly accused of a terrible crime.</p>

    - Old Man and the Sea
    - Book
    - Ernest Hemingway
    - <P> <I>The Old Man and the Sea</I> is one of Hemingway's most enduring works. Told in language of great simplicity and power, it is the story of an old Cuban fisherman, down on his luck, and his supreme ordeal -- a relentless, agonizing battle with a giant marlin far out in the Gulf Stream. Here Hemingway recasts, in strikingly contemporary style, the classic theme of courage in the face of defeat, of personal triumph won from loss. Written in 1952, this hugely successful novella confirmed his power and presence in the literary world and played a large part in his winning the 1954 Nobel Prize for Literature.

    - Book
    - A. B. Guthrie Jr.
    - An enormously entertaining classic, THE WAY WEST brings to life the adventure of the western passage and the pioneer spirit. The sequel to THE BIG SKY, this celebrated novel charts a frontiersman's return to the untamed West in 1846. Dick Summers, as pilot of a wagon train, guides a group of settlers on the difficult journey from Missouri to Oregon. In sensitive but unsentimental prose, Guthrie illuminates the harsh trials and resounding triumphs of pioneer life. With THE WAY WEST, he pays homage to the grandeur of the western wilderness, its stark and beautiful scenery, and its extraordinary people.

    - Guard of Honor
    - Book
    - James Gould Cozzens
    - "<i>Guard of Honor</i> is a neglected masterpiece that stands comparison with the greatest novels of the Second World War--essayist Noel Perrin deemed it \"probably the best war novel of the twentieth century.\"<br>\t<br>James Gould Cozzens's <i>Guard of Honor</i> won the Pulitzer Prize in 1949. The novel balances a vast cast of intricately enmeshed characters as they react over the course of three tense days in September 1943 to a racial incident on a U.S. Army airbase in Florida. The reader is acutely aware of the war raging abroad and the effect it has had, or will have, on the multitude of servicemen who populate Cozzens's immense canvas. As Noel Perrin commented in <i>The Washington Post Book World:</i> \"There is material for two or three hundred movies in <i>Guard of Honor</i>.\"<br>\t<br>\"No other American novelist of our time writes with such profound understanding of the wellsprings of human character and of the social pressures that help to form it,\" said Orville Prescott in <i>The New York Times</i>. As Brendan Gill observed in <i>The New Yorker</i>: \"Every page of <i>Guard of Honor</i> gives the impression of a writer at the very top of his powers setting out to accomplish nothing less than his masterwork.\"<br>"

    - David Halberstam
    - <P> "One of the best books I've ever read about American sports!"  <br>--Christopher Lehmann-Haupt, <i>The New York Times</i></P>    <P>Available for the first time in years, David Halberstam's <i>The Breaks of the Game</i> focuses on one grim season (1979-80) in the life of the Portland Trail Blazers, a team that only three years before had been National Basketball Association champions. </p><P><P>As Halberstam follows this collection of men through the months, through the losing streaks and occasional victories, the endless trips and the brutal schedules, we come to know them and their world--the other players, coaches, and owners; the competition, drafts, trades, and traditions; the wives, the fans, the media connections--a world of grand dreams, impossible expectations, and bracing realities.  </p><P><P>The tactile authenticity of Halberstam's knowledge of the basketball world is unrivaled.  Yet he is writing here about far more than just basketball. This is a story about a place in our society where power, money, and talent collide and sometimes corrupt, a place where both national obsessions and naked greed are exposed. It's about the influence of big media, the fans and the hype they subsist on, the clash of ethics, the terrible physical demands of modern sports (from drugs to body size), the unreal salaries, the conflicts of race and class, and the consequences of sport converted into mass entertainment and athletes transformed into superstars--all presented in a way that puts the reader in the room and on the court, and <i>The Breaks of the Game</i> in a league of its own.</p>
