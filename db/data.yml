    - Geraldine Brooks
    - "  From Louisa May Alcott\xE2\x80\x99s beloved classic <I>Little Women</I>, Geraldine Brooks has animated the   character of the absent father, March, and crafted a story \"filled with the ache of love and marriage and   with the power of war upon the mind and heart of one unforgettable man\" (Sue Monk Kidd). With  \"pitch-perfect writing\" (<I>USA Today</I>), Brooks follows March as he leaves behind his family to aid   the Union cause in the Civil War. His experiences will utterly change his marriage and challenge his most   ardently held beliefs. A lushly written, wholly original tale steeped in the details of another time,   <I>March</I> secures Geraldine Brooks\xE2\x80\x99s place as a renowned author of historical fiction."

    - Jeffrey Eugenides
    - "<b>A dazzling triumph from the bestselling author of <i>The Virgin Suicides</i>--the astonishing tale of a gene that passes down through three generations of a Greek-American family and flowers in the body of a teenage girl.</b><br><br>In the spring of 1974, Calliope Stephanides, a student at a girls' school in Grosse Pointe, finds herself drawn to a chain-smoking, strawberry blond clasmate with a gift for acting. The passion that furtively develops between them--along with Callie's failure to develop--leads Callie to suspect that she is not like other girls. In fact, she is not really a girl at all.<br><br>The explanation for this shocking state of affairs takes us out of suburbia- back before the Detroit race riots of 1967, before the rise of the Motor City and Prohibition, to 1922, when the Turks sacked Smyrna and Callie's grandparents fled for their lives. Back to a tiny village in Asia Minor where two lovers, and one rare genetic mutation, set in motion the metamorphosis that will turn Callie into a being both mythical and perfectly real: a hermaphrodite.<br><br>Spanning eight decades--and one unusually awkward adolescence- Jeffrey Eugenides's long-awaited second novel is a grand, utterly original fable of crossed bloodlines, the intricacies of gender, and the deep, untidy promptings of desire. It marks the fulfillment of a huge talent, named one of America's best young novelists by both <i>Granta </i>and <i>The New Yorker</i>.<br>"

    - The Road
    - Book
    - Cormac McCarthy
    - |-
      A searing, postapocalyptic novel destined to become Cormac McCarthys masterpiece.
      
      A father and his son walk alone through burned America. Nothing moves in the ravaged landscape save the ash on the wind. It is cold enough to crack stones, and when the snow falls it is gray. The sky is dark. Their destination is the coast, although they dont know what, if anything, awaits them there. They have nothing; just a pistol to defend themselves against the lawless bands that stalk the road, the clothes they are wearing, a cart of scavenged foodand each other.
      
      The Road is the profoundly moving story of a journey. It boldly imagines a future in which no hope remains, but in which the father and his son, each the others world entire, are sustained by love. Awesome in the totality of its vision, it is an unflinching meditation on the worst and the best that we are capable of: ultimate destructiveness, desperate tenacity, and the tenderness that keeps two people alive in the face of total devastation.

In "A Temporary Matter," published in The New Yorker, a young Indian-American couple faces the heartbreak of a stillborn birth while their Boston neighborhood copes with a nightly blackout.

Lahiri writes with deft cultural insight reminiscent of Anita Desai and a nuanced depth that recalls Mavis Gallant. She is an important and powerful new voice.

    - "As the American century draws to an uneasy close, Philip Roth gives us a novel of unqualified greatness that is an elegy for all our century's promises of prosperity, civic order,  and domestic bliss. Roth's protagonist is Swede Levov, a legendary athlete at his Newark high school, who grows up in the booming postwar years to marry a former Miss New Jersey, inherit his father's glove factory, and move into a stone house in the idyllic hamlet of Old Rimrock. And then one day in 1968, Swede's beautiful American luck deserts him.<br><br>For Swede's adored daughter, Merry, has grown from a loving, quick-witted girl into a sullen, fanatical teenager\xE2\x80\x94a teenager capable of an outlandishly savage act of political terrorism. And overnight Swede is wrenched out of the longer-for American pastoral and into the indigenous American berserk. Compulsively readable, propelled by sorrow, rage, and a deep compassion for its characters, this is Roth's masterpiece."

    - Sidney Poitier
    - "\"I have no wish to play the pontificating fool, pretending that I\xE2\x80\x99ve suddenly come up with the answers to all life\xE2\x80\x99s questions. Quite that contrary, I began this book as an exploration, an exercise in self-questing. In other words, I wanted to find out, as I looked back at a long and complicated life, with many twists and turns, how well I\xE2\x80\x99ve done at measuring up to the values I myself have set.\"  <BR>--Sidney Poitier    <P>In this luminous memoir, a true American icon looks back on his celebrated life and career. His body of work is arguably the most morally significant in cinematic history, and the power and influence of that work are indicative of the character of the man behind the many storied roles. Sidney Poitier here explores these elements of character and personal values to take his own measure -- as a man, as a husband and a father, and as an actor.    <P>Poitier credits his parents and his childhood on tiny Cat Island in the Bahamas for equipping him with the unflinching sense of right and wrong and of self-worth that he has never surrendered and that have dramatically shaped his world. \"In the kind of place where I grew up,\" recalls Poitier, \"what\xE2\x80\x99s coming at you is the sound of the sea and the smell of the wind and momma\xE2\x80\x99s voice and the voice of your dad and the craziness of your brothers and sisters \xE2\x80\xA6 and that\xE2\x80\x99s it.\" Without television, radio, and material distractions to obscure what matters most, he could enjoy the simple things, endure the long commitments, and find true meaning in his life.    <P>Poitier was uncompromising as he pursued a personal and public life that would honor his upbringing and the invaluable legacy of his parents. Just a few years after his introduction to indoor plumbing and the automobile, Poitier broke racial barrier after racial barrier to launch a pioneering acting career. Committed to the notion that what one does for a living articulates to who one is, Poitier played only forceful and affecting characters who said something positive, useful, and lasting about the human condition.    <P>Here is Poitier\xE2\x80\x99s own introspective look at what has informed his performances and his life. Poitier explores the nature of sacrifice and commitment, price and humility, rage and forgiveness, and paying the price for artistic integrity. What emerges is a picture of a man in the face of limits \xE2\x80\x93 his own and the world\xE2\x80\x99s. A triumph of the spirit, <I>The Measure of a Man</i> captures the essential Poitier."

    - Leo Tolstoy
    - <I>Anna Karenina</I> tells of the doomed love affair between the  sensuous and rebellious Anna and the dashing officer, Count  Vronsky. Tragedy unfolds as Anna rejects her passionless marriage and  must endure the hypocrisies of society. Set against a vast and richly  textured canvas of nineteenth-century Russia, the novel's seven major  characters create a dynamic imbalance, playing out the contrasts of  city and country life and all the variations on love and family  happiness.  While previous versions have softened the robust, and  sometimes shocking, quality of Tolstoy's writing, Pevear and  Volokhonsky have produced a translation true to his powerful  voice. This award-winning team's authoritative edition also includes  an illuminating introduction and explanatory notes. Beautiful,  vigorous, and eminently readable, this <I>Anna Karenina</I> will be  the definitive text for generations to come.

    - The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter (Oprah's Book Club)
    - Book
    - Carson McCullers
    - With the publication of her first novel, THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER,  Carson McCullers, all of twenty-three, became a literary  sensation. With its profound sense of moral isolation and its  compassionate glimpses into its characters' inner lives, the novel is  considered McCullers' finest work, an enduring masterpiece first  published by Houghton Mifflin in 1940. At its center is the deaf-mute  John Singer, who becomes the confidant for all various types of  misfits in a Georgia mill town during the 1930s. Each one yearns for  escape from small town life. When Singer's mute companion goes insane,  Singer moves into the Kelly house, where Mick Kelly, the book's  heroine (and loosely based on McCullers), finds solace in her  music. Wonderfully attune to the spiritual isolation that underlies  the human condition, and with a deft sense for racial tensions in the  South, McCullers spins a haunting, unforgettable story that gives  voice to the rejected, the forgotten, and the mistreated -- and,  through Mick Kelly, gives voice to the quiet, intensely personal  search for beauty.<BR> Richard Wright praised Carson McCullers for her  ability "to rise above the pressures of her environment and embrace  white and black humanity in one sweep of apprehension and tenderness."  She writes "with a sweep and certainty that are overwhelming," said  the NEW YORK TIMES. McCullers became an overnight literary sensation,  but her novel has endured, just as timely and powerful today as when  it was first published. THE HEART IS A LONELY HUNTER is Carson  McCullers at her most compassionate, endearing best.

    - "<p>One of the 20th century's enduring works, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> is a widely beloved and acclaimed novel known throughout the world, and the ultimate achievement in a Nobel Prize\xE2\x80\x93winning career.</p> <p>The novel tells the story of the rise and fall of the mythical town of Macondo through the history of the Buend\xC3\xADa family. It is a rich and brilliant chronicle of life and death, and the tragicomedy of humankind. In the noble, ridiculous, beautiful, and tawdry story of the Buend\xC3\xADa family, one sees all of humanity, just as in the history, myths, growth, and decay of Macondo, one sees all of Latin America.</p> <p>Love and lust, war and revolution, riches and poverty, youth and senility -- the variety of life, the endlessness of death, the search for peace and truth -- these universal themes dominate the novel. Whether he is describing an affair of passion or the voracity of capitalism and the corruption of government, Gabriel Garc\xC3\xADa M\xC3\xA1rquez always writes with the simplicity, ease, and purity that are the mark of a master.</p> <p>Alternately reverential and comical, <i>One Hundred Years of Solitude</i> weaves the political, personal, and spiritual to bring a new consciousness to storytelling. Translated into dozens of languages, this stunning work is no less than an accounting of the history of the human race.</p>"

    - Elie Wiesel
    - <I>Night</I> is Elie Wiesel's masterpiece, a candid, horrific, and deeply  poignant autobiographical account of his survival as a teenager in the  Nazi death camps. This new translation by Marion Weisel, Elie's wife  and frequent translator, presents this seminal memoir in the language  and spirit truest to the author's original intent.  And in the  substantive new preface, Elie Wiesel reflects on the enduring  importance of <I>Night</I> and his lifelong, passionate dedication to  ensuring that the world never forgets man capacity for inhumanity to  man.    <P><I>Night</I> offers much more than a litany of the daily terrors, everyday  perversions, and rampant sadism at Auschwitz and Buchenwald; it also  eloquently addresses many of the philosophical as well as personal  questions implicit in any serious consideration of what the Holocaust  was, what it meant, and what its legacy is and will be.

As Emperor of the Known Universe, he possesses more power than a single man was ever meant to wield. Worshipped as a religious icon by the fanatical Fremens, Paul faces the enmity of the political houses he displaced when he assumed the throne-and a conspiracy conducted within his own sphere of influence. <br/><br/> And even as House Atreides begins to crumble around him from the machinations of his enemies, the true threat to Paul comes to his lover, Chani, and the unborn heir to his family's dynasty.

    - American Pastoral
    - Book
    - Philip Roth
    - "As the American century draws to an uneasy close, Philip Roth gives us a novel of unqualified greatness that is an elegy for all our century's promises of prosperity, civic order,  and domestic bliss. Roth's protagonist is Swede Levov, a legendary athlete at his Newark high school, who grows up in the booming postwar years to marry a former Miss New Jersey, inherit his father's glove factory, and move into a stone house in the idyllic hamlet of Old Rimrock. And then one day in 1968, Swede's beautiful American luck deserts him.<br><br>For Swede's adored daughter, Merry, has grown from a loving, quick-witted girl into a sullen, fanatical teenager\xE2\x80\x94a teenager capable of an outlandishly savage act of political terrorism. And overnight Swede is wrenched out of the longer-for American pastoral and into the indigenous American berserk. Compulsively readable, propelled by sorrow, rage, and a deep compassion for its characters, this is Roth's masterpiece."

    - Book
    - Steven Millhauser
    - Young Martin Dressler begins his career as an industrious helper in his father's cigar store.  In the course of his restless young manhood, he makes a swift and eventful rise to the top, accompanied  by two sisters--one a dreamlike shadow, the other a worldly business partner.

In <I>The Good Earth</I> she presents a graphic view of a China when the last emperor reigned and the vast political and social upheavals of the twentieth century were but distant rumblings for the ordinary people. This moving, classic story of the honest farmer Wang Lung and his selfless wife O-lan is must reading for those who would fully appreciate the sweeping changes that have occurred in the lives of the Chinese people during this century. <P> Nobel Prize winner Pearl S. Buck traces the whole cycle of life: its terrors, its passions, its ambitions and rewards. Her brilliant novel -- beloved by millions of readers -- is a universal tale of the destiny of man."
